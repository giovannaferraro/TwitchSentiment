6138.0,438cdaad094937e3b77494449bf0a06c8af48d06,sins of the prophets is the halo mod they stick very close to the lore and playing with the flood is a death wish lol 
6167.0,438cdaad094937e3b77494449bf0a06c8af48d06,to be clear you can't play as the flood but the flood replaces the pirates and they can just rapidly take over 
6173.0,438cdaad094937e3b77494449bf0a06c8af48d06,just like in lore 
6205.0,438cdaad094937e3b77494449bf0a06c8af48d06,yep 
6261.0,438cdaad094937e3b77494449bf0a06c8af48d06,my favorite is sta3 of course but to transition from base game into mods i think interregnum is the best it adds the empire and rebels as additional factions to the base game 
6379.0,438cdaad094937e3b77494449bf0a06c8af48d06,yeah the pirates are annoying they are just enough to do some damage and slow you down but not enough to seriously cripple you 
6413.0,438cdaad094937e3b77494449bf0a06c8af48d06,the reason is once they kill enough the bounty is collected and they leave 
6449.0,438cdaad094937e3b77494449bf0a06c8af48d06,unfortunately when you have 300k+ bounties they don't tend to leave until destroyed 
6545.0,438cdaad094937e3b77494449bf0a06c8af48d06,the two factions attacking my ally keep taking planets and building two starbases around the planet it's super annoying to fight them both at once 
6715.0,8eccd76c0773bb5df3fb689367072d17b6cdfabb,sorry 438cdaad094937e3b77494449bf0a06c8af48d06 :[
