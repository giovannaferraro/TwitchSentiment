4675.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3 its a lot better looking and stable less buggy from rome 2 on release rome 2 was a dumpster fire on release 
4689.0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3,oh no doubt 
4700.0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3,but the city layout and ai tactics looks the exact same 
4728.0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3,i know i sound negative but just saying

4889.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,the biggest change to combat from rome 2 is that most of the sync kills were most taken out there's still a chance for your infantry to perform sync kills but the chance is very low 
4899.0,012046e7928fb150a7b7b99f3125dfcb333ddd5b,medieval ii the third empire mod was the best lord of the rings was unbelievable and it was like a stand alone game 
4900.0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3,napeleons effects were beautiful 
4923.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,napoleon was awesome 
4936.0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3,oh man i never got the lotr mod but i heard good things 
4944.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,shogun 2 fall of the samurai was great as well 
4958.0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3,back in the day when i had medieval i dont think my pc couldve handled mods 
4977.0,012046e7928fb150a7b7b99f3125dfcb333ddd5b,yeah i was amazed on how detailed it was hell there was the fellowship ring campaign 
4988.0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3,yes shogun 2 was good my problem with that whole series was that castles were completely impossible to seige until you got trebuchets 
5003.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3 the third age mod is great but its really hard saurons armies are relentless 
5004.0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3,which i mean is realistic but when every town is a castle it makes playing the game impossible 
5029.0,012046e7928fb150a7b7b99f3125dfcb333ddd5b,another problem with shogun for me was the lack of variety of units it seemed all the factions were too similar 
5037.0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3,i remember calling in naval artillery in battles in fall of the samurai ll 
5038.0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3,lol 
5050.0,2b6a32f2d7238bebe69d2e8b9c84cdd072cbddf3,yes they were 012046e7928fb150a7b7b99f3125dfcb333ddd5b 
5088.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,well all the factions in shogun 2 were part of the same country and culture so that kind of makes sense 
5111.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,playing as zheng jiang with a buddy of mine damn her campaign isn't easy 
5166.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,8f1c91c317c3737c4b780af71735f8234d57bdd8 are you playing in romance or records mode 
5188.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,cool thanks for confirming 
5204.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,yup very hard start and she has no settlements to start yuan shao is a dick 
5242.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940 she's the bandit queen general right 
5251.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,yup 
5281.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,sounds like a fun campaign start 
5285.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,she is absolutely disgusting in combat tho she slaughters in duels and even as a champion cuts through units pretty impressively 
5289.0,95e658d5a64820245ccd0dde55380fe55656be70,do you think the delegate is so bad because the ai doesn't value the champions/heroes like they should 
5303.0,5e81adae1b76ec35989618b0f3111efaf36c67ae,how do you like the game so far thinking about getting the game but not sure yet 
5322.0,d96e4f06454cef5dfbc3139c102f0bf104054ee4,holy shit cao cao's expansion lol 
5349.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,there is a site that you can buy the game on for around $47 gamespot did an article about the sale it works 
5370.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,every campaign i've seen has cao cao expanding like crazy 
5376.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,yes you can get married 
5392.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,the only times i've seen it happen is during events 
5494.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,good against high armor targets thats about it 
5499.0,9b15edc646db98139ce6ca41fb7b235329dc3c29,short range and low ammo are a minus 
5510.0,9b15edc646db98139ce6ca41fb7b235329dc3c29,even if the dmg they do is good 
5525.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,they're designed to punch through armored units 
5533.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,depends on the type of enemies you're facing 
5535.0,9b15edc646db98139ce6ca41fb7b235329dc3c29,didn't know that 
5536.0,00d739c29c3229d341d4a305cf7431ca1ca5aa2a,the game should have a perk to increase ammo amounts somwhere 
5545.0,038e28d80730cc56336085888c04abd351bac469,maybe they reload slower 
5575.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,they'd do well to beat up armored cavalry 
5580.0,60f5650a7eb3300c3caf717072dc1ee4cd47e2c1,if the general is blue the higher their cunning the more ammo 
5613.0,d96e4f06454cef5dfbc3139c102f0bf104054ee4,that legitimacy thing is unique to that guy's faction i think 
5618.0,d96e4f06454cef5dfbc3139c102f0bf104054ee4,it's like how cao cao has that credibility thing 
5687.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,not that i've seen 
5693.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,but you can swap units 
5700.0,60f5650a7eb3300c3caf717072dc1ee4cd47e2c1,the general's retinue's are locked to who recruited them 
5721.0,95e658d5a64820245ccd0dde55380fe55656be70,ya what is the best way to upgrade units as you progress 
5723.0,95e658d5a64820245ccd0dde55380fe55656be70,swap 
5724.0,4acb3ad2243cd730319c4abde65be9c21546ea64,you can rearrange them in settings pretty sure 
5743.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,95e658d5a64820245ccd0dde55380fe55656be70 yeah change a unit in the retinue 
5770.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,the changes they made to the army system seem really bad inconvenient to say the least 
5810.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,lancers do better against melee infantry the other guys are good for running down archers crossbowmen etc 
5892.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,yuan shao is kind of a dick that seems to be the consensus 
5992.0,95e658d5a64820245ccd0dde55380fe55656be70,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940 thank you 
6041.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,you will destroy him with the mandate of heaven 
6054.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,apparently ca is aware that yuan shao vassalizes other factions a bit higher than intended 
6061.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,so we'll see if that gets changed 
6139.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,that upkeep is pretty high 
6183.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,try it 
6269.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,yeah you can sack cities 
6277.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,i dont think you can raze but you can sack 
6307.0,95e658d5a64820245ccd0dde55380fe55656be70,i don't get how to vassalize factions myself 
6323.0,099510ac8ee3f130d907e5227c4fda6776614a71,yuan tan vassalized 12 factions in my current campaign he is untouchable now 
6329.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,they will shoot at you until you take the gate 
6345.0,c7fc0f09124b68ab649a300f21d56a3e27d7fe44,hueg towne

6391.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,from what i've seen yes they will shoot at you within the city 
6399.0,8bd8d599c4146a20f6819b174ebdfd4295367940,towers are very op in 3k cities are no joke to take they will hurt 
6418.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,you can break the blocked with artilery but its not really worth your time

6560.0,9b15edc646db98139ce6ca41fb7b235329dc3c29,always take out towers in range 
6633.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,that was a good shot 
6641.0,957a0863ad81b912c62aa335d2466749651cb4b9,from what i've seen fire arrows disable towers super fast 
6665.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,backspace 
6669.0,957a0863ad81b912c62aa335d2466749651cb4b9,like 4-5 vollies 
6671.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,to tell your unti to stop 
6769.0,72da8a3f83233108ffb936968950492686fc9cf0,i think it might be a good idea to break another gate and split up your forces then hit the enemy with a pincer attack 
6796.0,a66553cd9980866615cf5dacefe8e595bc3c7086,limited treb ammo
