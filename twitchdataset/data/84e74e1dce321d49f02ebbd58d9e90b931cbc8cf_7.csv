5941.0,ea0639c3802b602e15ccf04ffb5187c947a41add,play a few more bots till you get the hang of it 
5942.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,ye u can 
5950.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,but your decks are incomplete 
5954.0,86f7dc78e3168f6c1ffefc1b0f30738cda7232c7,i mean he literally has chat helping :p 
5957.0,656bd53186b4b63682d0379813d9aca9a2b30108,i'd recommend play over ranked 
5960.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,yea bot then normal play 
5965.0,1285f87b9fd37f3cdf64386bc711befcf8ee9c6b,best is to play the bots a bit more so you start to know the spells and basics of the game are very familiar 
5977.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,yep you are getting cards right 
5984.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,that make your deck stronger 
5984.0,656bd53186b4b63682d0379813d9aca9a2b30108,people in ranked take things more super serial play is just people getting their dailies done usually 
5996.0,ea0639c3802b602e15ccf04ffb5187c947a41add,like 2 or 3 more bots then normal play 
6011.0,86f7dc78e3168f6c1ffefc1b0f30738cda7232c7,656bd53186b4b63682d0379813d9aca9a2b30108 so doing random non-optimal shit just to hit the quest requirements 
6012.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,maybe 1 more bot red then normal play red 
6022.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,then vs bot with next colour dekc 
6037.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,yea that creature is good to shock 
6045.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,cuz if not he will get too much life

6107.0,656bd53186b4b63682d0379813d9aca9a2b30108,86f7dc78e3168f6c1ffefc1b0f30738cda7232c7 in my experience i quite a few months back people in ranked were more likely to grind out the long games with carefully crafted meta decks and a lot of control decks and be slower and more thoughtful taking their turns in play things were generally more casual people testing out fun stuff or just rushing red aggro to get dailies etc 
6109.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,its not in play yet

6150.0,86f7dc78e3168f6c1ffefc1b0f30738cda7232c7,it said 2 targets 
6160.0,86f7dc78e3168f6c1ffefc1b0f30738cda7232c7,didn't seem to specify 
6160.0,ea0639c3802b602e15ccf04ffb5187c947a41add,you will have the dragon next turn pretty much 
6162.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,but maybe it asays only creatures can be targeted

6181.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,yea so he could divide to the player but it wasnt worth it 
6209.0,1097349e12366bf43938540822c83ccd33dae8df,true 
6232.0,d3b92ef98b3110041611357e51a3d29f666dcc42,kaptivsip

6937.0,0102431f014d4f31f1c93f5bf0b9d355b3dd8828,with red it's typically more important to kill the opponent than to defend yourself 
6955.0,86f7dc78e3168f6c1ffefc1b0f30738cda7232c7,the system for earning cards is interesting in this

8953.0,656bd53186b4b63682d0379813d9aca9a2b30108,i always like to have a few cards i can build towards but you don't want too many high-cost cards clutttering up an aggro deck 
8962.0,d7090e09cf47427d47cf37c6b68ccf8582843e0d,if i was going for pure win percentage 
8977.0,d7090e09cf47427d47cf37c6b68ccf8582843e0d,i would take out 2 mountains the 2 shivan dragons and the big 7 mana dragon
