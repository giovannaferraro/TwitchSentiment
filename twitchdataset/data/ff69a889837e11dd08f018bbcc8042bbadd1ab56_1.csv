2557.0,ea1f6da45448b95648ca3f7d26fa16f2607bfe56,asymmetrical balance for the entire game is the dumbest thing a competitive game could do 
2586.0,3c0514faec7510aef10e98ca3460eb681c8da4db,i mean the game could be like every other rts where the factions have the same units but look slightly different

2597.0,3df4959dda17bf4a38cbe59207d87c3be0329d16,there's nothing fun in watching or playing a symmetrical game tho 
2604.0,ea1f6da45448b95648ca3f7d26fa16f2607bfe56,asymmetrical balance makes a lot of sense if things are balanced in the late game

2630.0,ea1f6da45448b95648ca3f7d26fa16f2607bfe56,like the first 10 or so minutes has different windows for each race but then things evened out afterwards

2770.0,4fa1351fbccb0c7693b8674b545ced49930a318e,because they are mostly very fragile so you have to learn about drops and stuff

3437.0,d69e64a09b900c1eb6982cd88603a25befc890bc,dzadzakin depends on if its one or 2 base 
3446.0,3c0514faec7510aef10e98ca3460eb681c8da4db,build like a 10x10 grid of spore crawlers and just teleport the bcs onto them
