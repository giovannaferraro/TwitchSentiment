786.0,cf0f739b2676611c45e299bce545c4223d21911e,all the pairs worked at least decently i think general consensus was that dimir and golgari tended to be quite good and ru wizards was possibly the best deck but quite uncommon dependent and could usually only support 1 person in a pod

1007.0,cf0f739b2676611c45e299bce545c4223d21911e,also it doen't get rid of counters or planeswalkers both of which are super common in war

1072.0,6a0995e64267e77784656b9f3c4b06db802fc9fe,if transmutation removed the creature's ability to attack like sky tether and deep freeze do it'd also be a lot more popular 
1103.0,cf0f739b2676611c45e299bce545c4223d21911e,i think i liked birds to plowshares more than deep freeze but both are pretty good

5791.0,a05a37ac9a84fcbb9ce98b860ee9baf200867f63,it also comes down to deckbuilding what colors you play e g as deathsie said earlier: you can stumble in a controlly deck but in an aggro deck if you get behind ur fckd 
5804.0,61dd88dcb99fcb59e4f57d9b2b4c394eb564fbee,9bd71e42948011105cf8088713a54db221371ef3 sorry i speak french i didn't want to be pedantic

5860.0,a05a37ac9a84fcbb9ce98b860ee9baf200867f63,if they hit it next turn with sweeper they dont 
5888.0,afdf3774b2e05613d98cbf16a6f9df89a0690adf,cause they are dead by then 
5906.0,a05a37ac9a84fcbb9ce98b860ee9baf200867f63,everyone needs to draw well for sure 
5911.0,6a0995e64267e77784656b9f3c4b06db802fc9fe,many people are inherently unwilling to take responsibility for the bad things that happen to them for sure same in team games people will always blame their teammates before themselves

5938.0,d3c38739bdb25c5248085641486f3145c3adf7f1,at the time we reach 6 mana opp probably played all their cards already
