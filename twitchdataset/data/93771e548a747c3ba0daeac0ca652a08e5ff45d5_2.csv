3618.0,a9484738d12e35a56b9bf05c385a21a2232d4ec6,i think arya could have been a bit more satisfying if it showed her faceless training as being integral to her take down of the night king - like if she was able to take a undead or white walker face and use it to get close to the night king instead of just charging up to him with all the wights and walkers behind him just - i dunno ignoring her

4609.0,dadde7e2e069ac5b972b4e1afebad2836268e62a,i think he worged into them so that the nk could sense where he was tbh not sure what it was for otherwise
