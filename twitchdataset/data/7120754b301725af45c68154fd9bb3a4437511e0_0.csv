144.0,d5faf6eec791ac609851f6f1c32a84fd9d37e730,wait what lol 
184.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,b/c humans uptick jeskai is arguably our worst match-up or that'd be my guess

204.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,jeeze 4 ascension main 
265.0,fc6ada4ccb2ada3c8f7c83e276ed04e480af0c89,zach is not playing esper so this is how it ends not with a bang but with jeskai 
289.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,yeah 4 seems like a lot 
300.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i think lightning bolt is more important than anything black could bring to u/w in a ktgc format 
340.0,eb0e83ccb4dbb950060a51be19bb06beec58195c,are subs supposed to see ads

378.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,yeah thats what a 5 for 1 
379.0,fc6ada4ccb2ada3c8f7c83e276ed04e480af0c89,7bbc4e4c1ac1200203fb53edef619c0f857d88dd karn the great creator 
406.0,7bbc4e4c1ac1200203fb53edef619c0f857d88dd,thanks:red_heart: 
410.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,having no response to ktgc -2 currently is probably not going to win you many games 
437.0,bd4490be5955bc0012d86110d2cdaf1d45754720,wow zach too skilled 
437.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,ouch 
451.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,#peakmodern 
464.0,7bbc4e4c1ac1200203fb53edef619c0f857d88dd,that's miserable 
478.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i love surgical lol if i were playing modern i don't think i'd register a deck without a few somewhere and likely a few in the mainboard 
517.0,7bbc4e4c1ac1200203fb53edef619c0f857d88dd,mainboard hate does not make for a good format 
532.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,its a powerful card but phyrexian mana is just awful awful design imo 
534.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,playing 2 creatures main coming back to bite donegan 
547.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,yeah modern is a pretty messed up format at the moment lul 
570.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,i don't think modern is that awful but maybe i am in the minority 
578.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,i can't get onboard with the phoenix decks not running crackly d 
581.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i would be really curious what wotc ends up deciding to do if they bring phyrexians back for a set instead of doing phyrexian mana 
601.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,like obviously bringing back phyrexian mana would be a terrible idea so i'm curious what mechanic they would give for the phyrexians instead 
654.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,i think they'd need to make the life cost actually relevant like dismember typically has a much more meaningful cost than sugical/revival/gut shot/ etc 
654.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,i think modern is an exceedingly linear format and that's totally fine 
657.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,off subject anyone else waiting on their seb mckinnon playmats/prints ? :) very excited 
667.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,man i was sad this morning when i finally looked at the mf providence schedule and realized there's no standard mcqs feelsbadman not even sure if i should go at this point 
670.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,i don't think modern is the place to go if you want fair magic 
687.0,bd4490be5955bc0012d86110d2cdaf1d45754720,i just strongly dislike how the new pw have warped the format esp karn but that's personal preference 
713.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,all the new karn does is give tron a slightly different haymaker 
725.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,linearity is just boring imo boring to play boring to watch 
731.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,i think saying they have warped the format is a bit hyperbolic at this point it's still early and lots of players are experimenting i think that's healthy 
745.0,76395d3c5320877f527c23c9e9d225ee8f6a469a,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292 yeah the lack of fair decks seems ptrety bad 
768.0,362c453329b9f0eb4f41e5e3ea93858cada2225a,i think anythign that gets ppl away form playing phoenix is fine with me that deck is so boring 
777.0,362c453329b9f0eb4f41e5e3ea93858cada2225a,even tron 
778.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,so legacy is a fairer format but the cost is every fair deck in legacy looks the sam 
791.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,what does fair even mean people throw around fair/linear/degenerate etc and none of it has any real meaning it's just some personal distaste for a play-pattern 
793.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,point of order we're watching a control deck win on camera right now 
813.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,i'd say control is pretty fair 
821.0,bd4490be5955bc0012d86110d2cdaf1d45754720,both humans and uw are good now i'm not sure what people are talking about re the lack of “fair” decks 
822.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3 completely false 
824.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3 i think fair usually refers to a deck that's not trying to just kill you asap or get some combo to do that 
841.0,ad2ca8a128f2695ce847ef02082e0a69b101fac9,the other two terms are more subjective but linear has a pretty clear and distinct meaning 
843.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i definitely agree that control is a fair deck the rock and jund are other great examples of fair decks 
873.0,ad2ca8a128f2695ce847ef02082e0a69b101fac9,i mean gds is fair 
880.0,ad2ca8a128f2695ce847ef02082e0a69b101fac9,you don't see it that much anymore 
883.0,bd4490be5955bc0012d86110d2cdaf1d45754720,also phoenix is much closer to fair than unfair on the spectrum 
895.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,yeah i think i'd say gds is pretty fair i think humans is kind of on the fence because it tries to kill you fast 
896.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,humans on the upswing means gds on the downswing 
900.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,phoenix is nowhere near fair 
902.0,362c453329b9f0eb4f41e5e3ea93858cada2225a,fair is less common in modern than unfair assuming modern will be fair is a recipe for losing 
906.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,phoenix is definitely in the gray area between being fair and unfair 
915.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,phoenix is probably the definition of unfair noncombo 
920.0,76395d3c5320877f527c23c9e9d225ee8f6a469a,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f the problem is jund and others midrange decks are disappearing 
924.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,how is phoenix not fair it does a lot of hand waving 
928.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,like tron 
943.0,ad2ca8a128f2695ce847ef02082e0a69b101fac9,the main problem with modern right now is just the yard everyone has to be super conscious of it all the time in their boarding and even their main choices 
958.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,76395d3c5320877f527c23c9e9d225ee8f6a469a yes i am very sad at this myself as a midrange player hopefully some of the new walkers like time raveler can help bring a modern midrange deck back 
977.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,is that a real question one mana to discard two phonixes and then mana morphose cantrip cantrip swing for six is fair lol 
977.0,ad2ca8a128f2695ce847ef02082e0a69b101fac9,the format probably improves if they ban faithless looting 
987.0,362c453329b9f0eb4f41e5e3ea93858cada2225a,i think people just fight the idea or fair vs unfair too much accept the way things are and plan accordingly 
987.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,if you want to make modern better imo it involves banning cards and not just shoving more things in the pool 
991.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i think bant midrange built around vivien champion of the wilds and time raveler has some serious potential once modern horizons comes out 
1004.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,i think they should ban manamorphose if anything 
1024.0,ad2ca8a128f2695ce847ef02082e0a69b101fac9,manamorphose would be another option but that doesn't hit dredge 
1029.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i feel like turn 1 giver of runes into turn 2 gaddock teeg / meddling mage could be a pretty strong curve 
1032.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,but they will probably leave it alone until several months after horizons 
1037.0,ad2ca8a128f2695ce847ef02082e0a69b101fac9,so it depends on how they want to roll it 
1042.0,362c453329b9f0eb4f41e5e3ea93858cada2225a,speakign of control being fair small teferi is tremendously unfair 
1061.0,362c453329b9f0eb4f41e5e3ea93858cada2225a,so 
1069.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,yeah i'm amazed i haven't seen small teferi yet though i only just joined 
1082.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,like i think zach is making a mistake not having him in the deck 
1093.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i feel like 2 of narset and 1 of time raveler was better 
1095.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,we saw it in a bant infect last round but it didnt do much 
1109.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i probably would've done 2 of narset 2 of time raveler and 2 of hero of dominaria myself 
1128.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,good 
1130.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,i am on 2-2-2-2 playing uw and loving it 
1159.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,but i may be biased because i've been playing basically exclusively time raveler decks since war released so i obviously think he's absurdly powerful 
1190.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f have you tested out uw mid-range w/ sq / ttr 
1217.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3 no i don't really play modern because i don't have any cards feelsbadman i just like thinking about the theory lul 
1259.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,modo is a great way to get into modern :) 
1277.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,one of these days though i'm going to build up my uw control list i already have 4x of hero of dominaria 4x time raveler etc but jtms and snapcaster mage are so much 
1291.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i actually built up uw in modo a while ago but i don't play it too much because you have to pay to get into leagues 
1327.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,maybe now that war is out i might return to it some 
1410.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3 have you tried any ashiok in your list 
1546.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e testing in the sb ashiok slow on the draw but otherwise has potential 
1595.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3 just wondering if she makes a good answer to amulet since it's one of our worst mu 
1657.0,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e as some who plays a decent amount of play on amulet and played against an ashiok it was rough 
1666.0,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694,someone* 
1801.0,ad2ca8a128f2695ce847ef02082e0a69b101fac9,he hit two lootings 
1824.0,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694,3 lootings exiled if i saw correctly 
1829.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694 have you found damping sphere to be a difficult card to play around thinking of swapping my sphere for ashiok since storm doesnt see much play anymore and tron requires different answers i think 
1861.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,i think d sphere is still required as at least a 1-of it has a lot of range 
1883.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,sphere is much easier to remove for amulet i would think 
1906.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,i mean in general not specifically vs amulet 
2036.0,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e dampening sphere slows us down but isnt as impactful as ashiok i still like dampening shpere more because its good against other decks like tron plus the new spice for amulet is 4 drop karn into microsynth lattice(from our sb and ashiok doesnt stop that 
2088.0,f5f04475d97261cf29615d103ca650ea7bce0a6c,ashiok got attacked for 7 this game right 
2102.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694 yeah every deck and their brother are playing that combo 
2128.0,c9de6505c110df71263f7fe8b0b94f93811f3b2c,ashiok was activated twice and bolted never attacked 
2129.0,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694,a fun note tho is that ashiok being a 3 drop makes e e awkward since thats the cmc of other impactful cards of ours like azusa and coalition relic 
2137.0,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694,you say that but we can turn 3 it 
2187.0,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694,turn 1 amulet turn 2 bounce land into azusa play 2 more bounces into karn turn 3 play 3 bounces into microsynth 
2242.0,81538d184004f8765a25676135e45a2c63fd2daa,that's a lot of things resolving against a control deck 
2275.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,especially once force of negation hits 
2299.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,but yeah amulet is a rough mu for uw 
2325.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i think this is why jeskai is going to be so important 
2341.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,you can feel safe using your counters on other things and falling back on just bolting the ktgc when they use the -2 
2344.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,or esper 
2362.0,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694,uw our plan is more value based than jamming the karn into microsynth lattice but that sequences is very strong against alot of the linear decks with little interaction 
2419.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i was thinking about the legacy ktgc deck this morning that tries to go ancient tomb turn 1 city of traitors into ktgc -2 for a lion's eye diamond then play the diamond turn 2 then turn 3 tap their mana crack the diamond -2 for the mycosinth and play it immediately 
2430.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,like what does that deck do if you just bolt the ktgc in response to them cracking the diamond 
2446.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,they discard their entire hand have an ancient tomb and city of traitors on board and no other permanents

2647.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,hoping these 2 archetypes are shadowrealmed after horizons is legal 
2653.0,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694,gc main is interesting for dredge 
2656.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i feel like he plays something totally different every week last week he was top 3 with mono-red 
2673.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,don't think dredge is the type of deck you just pick up one week 
2688.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,these decks are there to feast on people's mopey brews and i love it 
2695.0,3275d2974c58b60a638f628efd3c1dfd35a63aa0,sure it is 
2695.0,7f7b9845f1224d9d19cfaad7eab1e8b7738ef694,nah man i love dredge i've had the deck since the older version with bridge and greater gargadon 
2703.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,oh of course that's what's impressive to me that he has such a range playing decks that are not always easy 
2724.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,does finale show up in sasser 
2731.0,ee9cf43bb143aa6e39da9c731790802111eba558,i'm trying to learn what some of the main decks in modern are and how they work - trying to follow a dredge deck on timewalk is mental lol 
2771.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,2 pyro ascension no md surgical or noxious revival 
2774.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,ee9cf43bb143aa6e39da9c731790802111eba558 mtggoldfish is a good site to see the metagame

2781.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,the big motor is putting bloodghasts and amalgams in the yard so you just play a land and put a ton of power into play 
2782.0,f749fb40b82a890aa16d09357da19e832936254b,dope 
2805.0,ee9cf43bb143aa6e39da9c731790802111eba558,i know but i'm at the stage where i'm learning through watching the decks play and interact with one another 
2819.0,6d6f3863b2e1e833c63f520ae8d348fe203748c0,you know what might be spicy post horizons alter of dementia in dredge 
2822.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,ah i gotcha 
2830.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,the other main combo dredge is going for is trying to life from the loam dredge the loam and play it repeatedly to get a bunch of lands in hand then flashback a conflagrate discarding the lands they got back with loam 
2845.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,dimentia + enduring ideal and a memnite is infinite 
2852.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,yep 
2852.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,seems super spicy 
2880.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,wait wrong card standby 
2920.0,ee9cf43bb143aa6e39da9c731790802111eba558,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f thanks for the overview :) 
2927.0,ad920458fcaab43723ee30d3fa29058665a5c858,hey guys 
2940.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i'm curious if wrenn and six could make a pure loam deck in modern playable probably not without stuff like glacial chasm or the dark depths combo 
2970.0,ad920458fcaab43723ee30d3fa29058665a5c858,i do like 
2973.0,ad920458fcaab43723ee30d3fa29058665a5c858,wrenn and six 
2989.0,ad920458fcaab43723ee30d3fa29058665a5c858,he seems like more of a sideboard card against decks that run ghost quarter and field of ruin 
2990.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,alter of dementia + enduring renewal + memntite is the infinite mill combo mah bad 
2998.0,e83c94fdb059312e24c62b616c05f37ef8e94fca,i almost like wrenn and six more in legacy than modern 
3010.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,yeah having redundancy on loam is important if your plan is to use loam to win but i think the combos aren't there in modern 
3011.0,e83c94fdb059312e24c62b616c05f37ef8e94fca,recurring wastelands is normally good 
3020.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,ross said wrenn and six is going into legacy lands 
3021.0,7241a890933cfa93b47327409664a9b849e46bcc,finale of promise is so good 
3022.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,yeah just recursive wasteland at that mana is neat 
3037.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,oh absolutely that guy is perfect for legacy lands 
3053.0,e83c94fdb059312e24c62b616c05f37ef8e94fca,and the 1 damage takes out a lot of the creatures in legacy 
3055.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,like having him and loam can probably let you do some gross stuff between being able to recur so many different lands 
3079.0,e83c94fdb059312e24c62b616c05f37ef8e94fca,7241a890933cfa93b47327409664a9b849e46bcc oh hai there todd 
3083.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,that is so true turn 2 wrenn and six on the play can snipe a delver which is really good 
3091.0,7241a890933cfa93b47327409664a9b849e46bcc,hi rogue 
3094.0,889eaeba53599a77d6eac05b1f8e202fcc9f1b62,roosip do you think with all the new goodies we can make a lands deck work in legacy without tabernacle 
3129.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,doubtful i feel like any legacy lands deck without tabernacle is just strictly worse than one with it 
3143.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,like i can't imagine a reason you wouldn't want at least 1 copy of it 
3186.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,yeah that deck isn't working without tabernacle 
3266.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,when did hollow one come out 
3280.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,amonkhet 
3284.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,one of the sets from that period 
3290.0,c9de6505c110df71263f7fe8b0b94f93811f3b2c,hour i believe 
3306.0,aedbd550379dc8b6cb3e0906bd68b85c12a7ea84,jimdomg jimdomg jimdomg 
3312.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,yeah it was hour of devestation 
3314.0,e83c94fdb059312e24c62b616c05f37ef8e94fca,hey jim davis is here too 
3321.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,we've been in this graveyard dominates thing since then 
3344.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,people figured out faithless looting is busted 
3359.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,dredge was always there doing dredge things 
3365.0,e83c94fdb059312e24c62b616c05f37ef8e94fca,for cards that want to load up the yard it is 1 mana draw 2 
3381.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,it's really good 
3424.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,hard cast creeping chill to win it 
3444.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,creeping chill arc light phoenix hollow one wotc wanted this 
3469.0,e83c94fdb059312e24c62b616c05f37ef8e94fca,i think it's more wotc occassionally forgets how good graveyard mechanics are 
3475.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,who knows though maybe they're planning a new rip in the next rotation or something 
3495.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,i like it so not complaining 
3503.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,obviously ashiok is a little helpful in that regard but maybe wotc has something stronger planned 
3509.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,we also had kci during this time 
3519.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,so glad kci got banned 
3555.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,yeah that's definitely the type of deck that just shouldn't be in mtg at all 
3594.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,when did sub only chat become a thing 
3595.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i thought the same about nexus though and here we are not even seeing it played ever so maybe we should have some faith in wotc being able to print cards that can weaken decks like that 
3615.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,last year it was sub only for first half or so 
3630.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,then open chat now this season/year it's been sub only 
3638.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i think both scg and the official magic streams switched to sub only this year 
3639.0,e83c94fdb059312e24c62b616c05f37ef8e94fca,sub only became a thing at the start of this year 
3643.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,okay i was wondering why it was so much slower haha 
3654.0,e83c94fdb059312e24c62b616c05f37ef8e94fca,however the scg weekday streams of vs live are open to all 
3662.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,mtg is getting bigger so it kind of makes sense to avoid the spam 
3704.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,gotcha thanks for the info 
3706.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,i prefer open chat but not my stream and still like scg 
3750.0,889eaeba53599a77d6eac05b1f8e202fcc9f1b62,i did start watching a lot less when we went sub only but eh rooshrug 
3772.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,holy crap i didn't even realize they put the glass cosmetic for time raveler on sale in mtga i'm always looking for ways to tilt my opponents more when i play time raveler lul 
3791.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,e83c94fdb059312e24c62b616c05f37ef8e94fca yea that is what got me mixed up vs live chat is great i wasnt aware opens were different fair enough i see both sides of the coin 
3809.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,yeah wide open twitch chat is ah 
3812.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,with 7k viewers 
3877.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,889eaeba53599a77d6eac05b1f8e202fcc9f1b62 i subbed bc i wouldn't watch without chat 
3974.0,ee9cf43bb143aa6e39da9c731790802111eba558,only change for me was i kept chat open still don't chat that much but with a free chat becomes completely unusable at that scale 
3983.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292 lol it looked hard to manage for sure but now that scg is competing with the mpl it might be worth it to offer chat 
3997.0,ee9cf43bb143aa6e39da9c731790802111eba558,is nice to see the discourse clearer 
4001.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,manamorphose should be in every deck that can cast it 
4009.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,i mean even when people are cool and chat is moderated with this many viewers it's just unreadable 
4028.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,i disagree i didnt have too much of a problem managing multiple conversations with the ee9cf43bb143aa6e39da9c731790802111eba558 abiliyy 
4059.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,it is much cleaner that is undeniable 
4105.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,what do you think manamorphose in burn 
4123.0,ee9cf43bb143aa6e39da9c731790802111eba558,and gets rid of a lot of the caps/meme spam that adds no value imo 
4166.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,its good to not see as much hate as open chat so thats nice i dont like manamorphose in burn wouldn't you just want to draw a burn spell 
4182.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03 nope burn needs to be on a 1 mana deal 3 plan or it stalls too fast only exception i've seen is risk factor 
4215.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,doesn't manamorphose in burn just act as free deck thinning 
4225.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,yeah theres plenty of burn to be played no need to include air 
4233.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,it's not free 
4235.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,burn is getting more card draw with horizons too so it's even less needed do lists currently play light up the stage 
4240.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,and you're playing eidolons 
4259.0,4680db716d3d8b439342ade7adda7b1a0710a52a,thank goodness twin isn't coming back 
4267.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,that's a good point 
4270.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3 i've seen some play stage 
4271.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,i'll give the eidolons might argue against it 
4275.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,morphose in the best case scenario is free deck thinning 
4281.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,you'd have to cut a burn spell or eidolon 
4311.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,but there's a lot of stuff that makes manamorphose worse 
4327.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,when it's not important to what you're doing it's not worth it 
4355.0,d3b1c8a3f49af8d3845541e12c2325d2c5c63292,the canopy lands are more interesting 
4385.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,how about manamorphose for infect to fill in for git probe 
4386.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,so you're thinning your deck but your burn spell count is also thinned street wraith might be better if you wanted some thinning in addition to the canopy lands but i doubt thats good at all

4783.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,i love that modern rewards knowing your deck and every matchup's 
4800.0,9b7a24f9e98bba350045023742ec977605553907,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e control has the highest win percentage in the format i think and im fine losing burn from the format ha 
4839.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,admittedly i would not enjoy goldfishing against each other so i always play interactive decks 
4841.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,burn will never be a dead dec

4917.0,224515cbd1e0f13967772ee6c6366e4d31471961,for showing sideboards isn't it better for both experienced and newer players to just show the card names instead of the thumbnails 
4928.0,508a1e3aa9e2c4fbd08f088a7ff25217fd7ae72e,esper gifts

4953.0,9b7a24f9e98bba350045023742ec977605553907,i agree that burn is fine if anything burn warps the format because unless you interact you will die by turn 5 like 80%+ of the time 
4972.0,6d6f3863b2e1e833c63f520ae8d348fe203748c0,there's no need for fof in uw control which is the only deck that would consider it 
4988.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,or burn vomits their hand like affinity and stalls in topdeck mode 
4991.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,lol 
4998.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,i think they'll play it

5012.0,ad2ca8a128f2695ce847ef02082e0a69b101fac9,see what i mean 0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3

5018.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,i misread his sentence i think it could be used in storm side boards i also disagree its worse than gifts nassif was playing 1/2 glimmer in uw fof could replace that 
5019.0,6d6f3863b2e1e833c63f520ae8d348fe203748c0,9b7a24f9e98bba350045023742ec977605553907 oh no dying on turn five in a turn 3 5 format whatever will we do 
5108.0,6d6f3863b2e1e833c63f520ae8d348fe203748c0,is this goryos deck better than neo grishoalbrand pre london mulligan even with everyone playing surgical 
5124.0,9b7a24f9e98bba350045023742ec977605553907,6d6f3863b2e1e833c63f520ae8d348fe203748c0 well turn 5 is almost a guarantee turn 4 is more likely and i've never heard modern being a turn 3 5 it's a turn 4 and i think that's based a lot on burn 
5173.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,ad2ca8a128f2695ce847ef02082e0a69b101fac9 na lol thoughtseize and stubborn denial are gas but yea goryos is a funny deck 
5175.0,9b7a24f9e98bba350045023742ec977605553907,not that other decks don't win turn 4 or as we just saw turn 2 but the speed at which burn wins kind of defines the speed of a format 
5176.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,a lot of people say it's a turn 3 or four format but not many games actually go that quickly 
5181.0,6d6f3863b2e1e833c63f520ae8d348fe203748c0,9b7a24f9e98bba350045023742ec977605553907 theres a dozen decks that have the game locked up by turn 3 it's faster than a turn four format 
5214.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,i don't know if i'd agree with a dozen decks that lock the game up by t3 
5234.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,there are not a dozen t1 decks 
5235.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,well can 
5248.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,very few games are over that quickly 
5261.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,can do something broken and consistently do are much different concepts 
5269.0,9b7a24f9e98bba350045023742ec977605553907,i think it depends on what you mean by turn 3 format like does that mean the game is over on turn 3 50% of the time 75% or the game is pretty much locked up by turn 3 50% 75% 
5308.0,9b7a24f9e98bba350045023742ec977605553907,yeah if it was based on the fastest thing decks can do then it's a turn 1 format 
5325.0,e83c94fdb059312e24c62b616c05f37ef8e94fca,that's a cool boar god 
5327.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,i think it means it's consistant enough that your deck needs to win fast or interact early to hang 
5370.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,otherwise you're playing a pet deck that will see minimal results in competitive events 
5392.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,a deck being required to interact or not lose doesn't mean it's opponent has won 
5405.0,6d6f3863b2e1e833c63f520ae8d348fe203748c0,i think you guys are underestimating the average linear vs linear deck game sure a blue white game can go 20 turns but thats not the average to go by 
5408.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,do people not remember when t1 burning inquiry into 2+ hallowed ones was the issue the format is too big there will always be a deck capable of doing crazy stuff turns 1-2 goryos doesn't even put up great results 
5420.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,interact or lose* i said that wrong 
5447.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3 right i've actually never faced this deck in a competitive event 
5457.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,kci used to win turn 4 regularly 
5464.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,friendlies on modo though i have 
5483.0,9b7a24f9e98bba350045023742ec977605553907,basically i think the whole “turn # format” thing is just a super generic interpretation of saying oh can't go “land go” x times ha 
5515.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,i think too many people parrot social media 
5533.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,i didn't think we'd ever see big teferi 
5537.0,986e0572aad965856625ddef544d6c178bee4c03,in modern 
5566.0,6d6f3863b2e1e833c63f520ae8d348fe203748c0,i think people assume people say it in a negative manner i'd love for it to be a turn one format let's go full legacy neo grishoalbrand is a great start 
5566.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,same i've played against it at fnm that's all sure turns 1-3 are the most important turns but its hard to base an entire format on individual deck's best draws that are low % 
5649.0,0d7974e56e5e1e11839a6f20606e6e19aac5abc3,but most people do use it in a negative manner 
5670.0,4f950a327c79a09b2cd82a5ecda586af7fabdd4e,that's what i mean though there's enough decks that win or force concession by t4 that you need to deck build around it and either have early interaction or play a fast deck 
5739.0,08176846333112f4fc9095e80b5011749da3f752,glasscannon deck 
5757.0,8d7a129025c276dcf665a7baa97e93f4c4edbba3,i agree with that description
