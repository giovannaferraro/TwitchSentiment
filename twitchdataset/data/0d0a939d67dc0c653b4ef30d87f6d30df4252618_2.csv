7546.0,981b8201257c018438aa2ea6b556a3bb629e3f9b,hmm not real enough 
7577.0,981b8201257c018438aa2ea6b556a3bb629e3f9b,how don't know the difference 
7592.0,0fe517c6747bf28635fc31bc406e9dc3bbf7217f,why do you think it's not realistic 
7632.0,981b8201257c018438aa2ea6b556a3bb629e3f9b,it is realistic but not enough 0fe517c6747bf28635fc31bc406e9dc3bbf7217f 
7641.0,0fe517c6747bf28635fc31bc406e9dc3bbf7217f,i see

7749.0,bd8e966c5027dcf91a123edf1dfdc33f6e356e10,we believe 
7753.0,981b8201257c018438aa2ea6b556a3bb629e3f9b,i like the game 
7761.0,554ab1d9bfb3edabcd21b8b71e05a586b7175191,you mean warhammer 
7802.0,981b8201257c018438aa2ea6b556a3bb629e3f9b,xd you could have won 
7904.0,981b8201257c018438aa2ea6b556a3bb629e3f9b,they need improvement in spying xd 
7948.0,554ab1d9bfb3edabcd21b8b71e05a586b7175191,spying is pretty good imo 
7968.0,554ab1d9bfb3edabcd21b8b71e05a586b7175191,but like total war is about the battle its not a paradox title 
7985.0,981b8201257c018438aa2ea6b556a3bb629e3f9b,honestly i have no gestation is just the to maintain relationship between faction is so have even in ez mode

8398.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,what are the differences from attila 
8407.0,981b8201257c018438aa2ea6b556a3bb629e3f9b,is is better than 3 kingdom 
8424.0,554ab1d9bfb3edabcd21b8b71e05a586b7175191,attila is wildly different 
8454.0,554ab1d9bfb3edabcd21b8b71e05a586b7175191,this one is a bit more like rome 
8465.0,554ab1d9bfb3edabcd21b8b71e05a586b7175191,but i would say its one of the more unique in the serie 
8467.0,981b8201257c018438aa2ea6b556a3bb629e3f9b,well gonna have some fun i will see you around <3 <3 <3 
8480.0,554ab1d9bfb3edabcd21b8b71e05a586b7175191,attila has like weird mechanics with the nomads and shit 
8489.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,i really have to buy 3 kingdoms but i'm afraid not to like 
8493.0,981b8201257c018438aa2ea6b556a3bb629e3f9b,i will it's really fun here 
8520.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,i'm getting a little bored from attila :d 
8602.0,0fe517c6747bf28635fc31bc406e9dc3bbf7217f,i like this campaign you can't go wrong targeting the north as it is historically wei kingdom territorry 
8608.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,are there turks and mongols in this game 
8614.0,0fe517c6747bf28635fc31bc406e9dc3bbf7217f,also your campaign has the 3 kingdoms at their exact locations 
8647.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,are there turks and mongols in this game 
8661.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,oh okey 
8698.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,sometimes i didnt understand im still learning 
8709.0,0fe517c6747bf28635fc31bc406e9dc3bbf7217f,i don't necessarily agree nor disagree it depends on what people seek variety wise it sure doesn't have much replayability but immersion wise it sure does 
8743.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,in which years the game 
8759.0,0fe517c6747bf28635fc31bc406e9dc3bbf7217f,personally i prefer the latter i have played this game campaign much more than warhammer where i only played multiplayer battles 
8786.0,0fe517c6747bf28635fc31bc406e9dc3bbf7217f,also there are no mongols or turks unfortuantely despite already being able to see the great china wall on the campaign map lol 
8794.0,0fe517c6747bf28635fc31bc406e9dc3bbf7217f,but maybe they can come later with dlcs 
8839.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,you play total war britannia 
8866.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,ends quickly 
8877.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,not worth the money 
8922.0,69deea29196ad23067f1a4234518ad30a499e9f5,16 dolar
