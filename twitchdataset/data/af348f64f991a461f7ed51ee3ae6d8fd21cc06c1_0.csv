813.0,1d215583915864b64b628ddeb331253da4a2b9a7,nah right now everything seems to be a better aggressive deck than red sadly that is 
830.0,46470f54a8c44a601946d1db802005b05d643aa2,mono b is probably it 
850.0,5878ac22c856b747eef9e8f88f7df1e2c00d247e,sultai oko has game vs very deck and imo you can beat bant ramp with the right sideboard and still have a good agrro matchup 
887.0,1d215583915864b64b628ddeb331253da4a2b9a7,mono b seems to struggle somewhat against flash tho atleast from what ive seen so far maybe ts just small sample size tho

6166.0,e666b67148d4bc7d781f58003aec584988eba7ef,questing beast is a bit situational
