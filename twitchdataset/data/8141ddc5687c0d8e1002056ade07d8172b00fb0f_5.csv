12.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,a5ffa9fe4daa0c1336f8b3d0d81eddd6724c5f6d i submitted one today it should be in the queue as soon as jeff has a chance to review 
15.0,0aacc91831b721f5b5b693612f3fd106b9ab81ee,it seems most decks with a cohesive/reasonable plan do well after rotation 
27.0,a5ffa9fe4daa0c1336f8b3d0d81eddd6724c5f6d,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77 my hero

56.0,150b61a7c9395ff8aa0890b09a9e03f3987f7644,i agree jeff but i don't think i have ever seen any competitive ladder system that doesn't disententivize playing at a certain point 
65.0,a17fa2d85119df071c767d7c60d7f6196029c7a5,if there wasn't rank decay wouldn't people just be discouraged from playing at the end of the season and sitting on their rank

73.0,1e10f57d8ddf844b730e534c7e0f7d27eb49955b,what was the deck idea 
75.0,c934308fc8daf3460628db397d341a9f8c73db6d,should win/loss ratio in your ranking matter more maybe

89.0,ba9062e2e0d5e91a7821f4d74a7a6c5bab32f67a,wicked wolf has been really good every time i've seen it 
93.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f conspiracy theory: they want you to not play on the ladder because all the other options have a money barrier 
95.0,aac4ee88f8d5b1eab682144df9c4a6387ef01a2a,speaking of which have you tried the reanimator deck 8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f 
103.0,0e5cdbdc2360eaf767d721671d5cede4baf39d95,a for profit company having to innovate!?? how dare 
105.0,bd20b2eb046091537b64646501b757da5798469a,reasons i dont play dota 2 anymore the ranked system is absolutely miserable 
107.0,7a884cdc10ddabbb32edbff3df1f35c2fd7bba13,with the dreadhorde invasion 
109.0,f282e2a4d7cd9b1ba2e9affbb50e1f6772c884b2,clearly they should just make ladder top 100 so then you have to keep playing for a spot kappa 
113.0,eee980cc52341501f870387dff145690c58395a3,hey jeff just got back how has this deck been doing 
126.0,c7d8caf84f1d9f0be2e89a00eeaf4a62939fc685,150b61a7c9395ff8aa0890b09a9e03f3987f7644 oldschool wow pvp ranks brutal grind but i guess once you hit max rank there was no incentive to keep going 
128.0,a17fa2d85119df071c767d7c60d7f6196029c7a5,i've had an 80% win rate with my sultai oko deck i'm excited to see your take 
135.0,9eab04d3183c1c73c23a8d7f3e8e7eee03b97924,i believe magic's current plan is to have small indie companies do it while claiming its impossible to do with so few resources then copy the indie company then have everyone act like magic is the gold standard 
144.0,6bb5c1211ad9d7fa421a9f833d31afe377a08ced,but jeff they didnt sell enough mythic editions to afford to innovate hooglcap 
171.0,07f399452b2a369e1b60f499cbc26096a232fedf,9eab04d3183c1c73c23a8d7f3e8e7eee03b97924 i would be fine with that if wotc would be better at copying the right things 
173.0,0aacc91831b721f5b5b693612f3fd106b9ab81ee,wotc innovated once their still all worn out from that one 
177.0,150b61a7c9395ff8aa0890b09a9e03f3987f7644,c7d8caf84f1d9f0be2e89a00eeaf4a62939fc685 that's a terrible example though because that system encouraged time spent in the system not skill 
184.0,aac4ee88f8d5b1eab682144df9c4a6387ef01a2a,that's like one of the most important parts lol 
188.0,c934308fc8daf3460628db397d341a9f8c73db6d,thrill of possibility 
198.0,98678246ac804a1e63a1e20b57f298a02e177798,they could institute a rating system similar to chess that would reward playing and directly change based on your opponents rating and competitiveness of match 
203.0,29ad22431a7c2575f51f06f4e65a3f136771b2c7,dob what instant-speed do they play

213.0,150b61a7c9395ff8aa0890b09a9e03f3987f7644,c7d8caf84f1d9f0be2e89a00eeaf4a62939fc685 the only way to get negative honor was a dhk you could lose 60% of all your 1v1s and be a top ranked pvper just based on time played 
233.0,9eab04d3183c1c73c23a8d7f3e8e7eee03b97924,98678246ac804a1e63a1e20b57f298a02e177798 that has the issue where chess rating is kind of opaque and vague-seeming for a lot of people 
238.0,c948e5fe5aee1fdf4eb0876b9388b721df168fca,503df1f51649b56860126a3f9a49ec343865dffc have you tried the jund adventure deck yet

257.0,eee980cc52341501f870387dff145690c58395a3,can anyone tell me how this deck has been so far 
258.0,ba9062e2e0d5e91a7821f4d74a7a6c5bab32f67a,it's funny how irrelevant instant speed is on thrill of possibility in almost any situation outside of like alliance or something 
262.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,jeff have you played bingo can't find the vod for that 
262.0,150b61a7c9395ff8aa0890b09a9e03f3987f7644,98678246ac804a1e63a1e20b57f298a02e177798 the problem with an elo system is that it assumes the better player wins every time this is a terrible system for an rng system and it's already too similar to what we have 
263.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,thanks 
264.0,87069f5de93d43be78ab7c23fc3708ddf01dc793,cant have volume on can someone in chat tell me how this deck is and is it fun

485.0,150b61a7c9395ff8aa0890b09a9e03f3987f7644,jeff i think the real problem with the mtg ladder system is that other games like starcraft and dota can kind of ignore the problem because people just make alt accounts and keep playing ladder but in this game if you make an alt account you lose your collection

664.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,that would also push bad aggressive decks since number of games would matter more than winning

845.0,9b3e5502423774d760eb1016ba908897e00dcba4,i meant you're great at this game but 
846.0,2669e42829ebfe9ee3366fb45e3a28a6cd7e9b11,i am completely with you on this but i honestly feel you ate a very good player even compared to an mpl player not exactly the same bit very close imho 
847.0,eee980cc52341501f870387dff145690c58395a3,they don't do anything similar at all 
848.0,3df1cfd0347cce320eaaea0650698e9cd0d470ca,i don't mean in what they do but in how oppressive they can be 
853.0,7a884cdc10ddabbb32edbff3df1f35c2fd7bba13,3fri takes away a part of the game oko is just a pushed card 
853.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,they don't do the same thing but they both make you feel miserable

858.0,906aa83ee743f94ba6e511157b7c0f2c72f05ed5,the only thing i am annoyed with oko is the fact that his +1 isn't like a -1 or even a 0 
861.0,78cd87ce9d319c78506f096b5e5218a3c5014214,oko doesn't have godawful static text 
861.0,cebf6064a9a4f18ced9469be4719ff30fd74d5b3,no but oko will fit into any deck of those colors 
862.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,3df1cfd0347cce320eaaea0650698e9cd0d470ca no 3feri is not overpowered but he causes awful play patters and bad magic oko is just a powerful card 
866.0,9b3e5502423774d760eb1016ba908897e00dcba4,what you were trying to say is if you faced someone at a much better skill level then you would still have a decent chance of winning 
869.0,f99ed81509edca6f75a909d72ca56ed546baa82f,sure they are people hate both

873.0,9b3e5502423774d760eb1016ba908897e00dcba4,i thought 
875.0,fbead430843e97daceeae4722437e9c9a681ed57,oko is the new nissa expect for 3 mana 
879.0,9b3e5502423774d760eb1016ba908897e00dcba4,i should say that's how i was hearing it 
881.0,1815ff080621561b2fded6b40066c24b855cd229,they both die to noxious grasp 
883.0,29ad22431a7c2575f51f06f4e65a3f136771b2c7,oko would be closer to a 5-mana t3fri scaled to 3 mana 
892.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,oko is bonkers good 3feri is just good but breaks magic

918.0,9eab04d3183c1c73c23a8d7f3e8e7eee03b97924,oko and teferi will likely both continue to be ubiquitous and i think a lot of people see card i see all the time and i don't like playing against it and that's where their train of thought ends 
920.0,906aa83ee743f94ba6e511157b7c0f2c72f05ed5,nah goose isn't what makes oko so strong 
920.0,7697629232bdafc49309dc5a432bb9d301282803,8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f you may not be an mpl or hof member but you are far from a timmy i have learned a lot from watching your stream that i haven't gotten from some of thoes top tier players hoogljester 
932.0,167d3b45ce5645dde6ef206a590cf621b0a777df,3 mana teferi dies to a 1/1 token regularly oko needs a targeted removal spell to kill 90% of the time 
936.0,906aa83ee743f94ba6e511157b7c0f2c72f05ed5,it's the cmc + the good numbers + very high utility 
943.0,82e82228183248d10d5ebb7d719b43b963ee86ad,they misprinted his elk making as a + ability im quite sure 
950.0,906aa83ee743f94ba6e511157b7c0f2c72f05ed5,haha 
950.0,ca35eea5c5443987ee280e1db9064d08e805ce32,i reckon the floor on teferi is a lot higher since at worst he's guaranteed to at least draw a card and tie up mana/creatures on the opponent's turn oko's floor is make a food token 
950.0,d497bda8691f4e06b7850c62940791a9d0d0aeab,quote

1064.0,07f399452b2a369e1b60f499cbc26096a232fedf,in nonblack decks it's hard in black you have the new exile something with cmc3+ 
1066.0,cc7fab1053d3eab1a75ea14efc9419d102431655,which is fair just a thought 
1067.0,b1abfe20422a0c40a3a47637fee13fb982f7f9c5,but is it good enough to beat field of the dead

4698.0,2e02787571237bf88d855219b8ca7e2b70cb2b7d,i found m20 limited quite good personally 
4699.0,afd1b5093a634658a317ca536ca87e1c1dda149e,anyone know what the card style rewards were for mythic this season 
4705.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,ok i buy this deck being the best oko deck i've seen so far 
4712.0,a448e9a2f4727e3cb8caf33a5b7ab83b41872afc,they were real bad 
4715.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,this looks so much better than all the bant ramp decks 
4721.0,1e629b7675b4bc1fb35c9da0b531039ac8a45b7d,so you could say that they once again printed a broken card to target previously op cards 
4721.0,afd1b5093a634658a317ca536ca87e1c1dda149e,well shit 
4724.0,9eab04d3183c1c73c23a8d7f3e8e7eee03b97924,cool horse bro

4731.0,c99fc049dc0c6d878e3d7127622ae20dd7e381e4,maybe they let crash and buddy pick their favorite cards 
4743.0,bed224798bdc2e9558545290c94bb2bc9b5d504e,oko make a 3/3 
4743.0,2103583b7bb3de8ccac8b6132289670bcb6aa2ea,just wait for ali to make a competitive scheming symmetry deck we'll be fine 
4749.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,ok fires was really good this game 
4759.0,3cb5aaf9ed7950c0b29e1355b7e18d27a62e4d4a,ehat was the unortodoxd way jeff triggerd ebon knight last match pls 
4775.0,492572132fd6de14ec4a618fd3bc2a71cd9ba453,transform their fires into a 3/3 
4777.0,1e54f77adef029c64156db605669c84c59738d7f,cool you can eat the food 
4779.0,e6c8e9c860856c81cf7b2f6898a602dfc03d1da4,shockland + murderous knight 
4780.0,dbfaf95b8df4dfbf282d4a82e8440ef996598822,was it really good yet 
4781.0,60f8a8dd49535de71e810e729f77cdf71fe22f52,3cb5aaf9ed7950c0b29e1355b7e18d27a62e4d4a shock land plus murderous rider 
4783.0,62990b50ac5858808b69ba03a552fee561cfdaba,i was thinking if we should have left paradise druid back last turn to hold up trophy but didn't see when it would be that good 
4786.0,3cb5aaf9ed7950c0b29e1355b7e18d27a62e4d4a,ty 
4788.0,b5fef43ee466f0a8a301f6951c265d607b860fd7,do you mind explains why you didn't assassin trophy the fires 
4792.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,dbfaf95b8df4dfbf282d4a82e8440ef996598822 that was a pretty big swing either way 
4796.0,492572132fd6de14ec4a618fd3bc2a71cd9ba453,oh artifact only my bad 
4801.0,3d99bd3b82f323c652749d44511d4193b0f19d15,killing fires does nothing 
4804.0,3d99bd3b82f323c652749d44511d4193b0f19d15,usually 
4813.0,dbfaf95b8df4dfbf282d4a82e8440ef996598822,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238 ouch now double clarion/cav is brutal 
4816.0,c9cad53872c3171fa90529fd8652b61624a8f928,i think jeff was just saying yesterday that a good fires deck would have cavaliers in it 
4821.0,3d99bd3b82f323c652749d44511d4193b0f19d15,its a good card 
4828.0,9eab04d3183c1c73c23a8d7f3e8e7eee03b97924,i think having mana sinks to use with fires like this is the real way to go 
4829.0,ba9062e2e0d5e91a7821f4d74a7a6c5bab32f67a,well this is what makes fires playable if anything good creatures with activated abiltiies 
4837.0,a448e9a2f4727e3cb8caf33a5b7ab83b41872afc,hopefully they're out of gain 7's 
4844.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,their lsit seems sweet 
4847.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,so far 
4853.0,bed224798bdc2e9558545290c94bb2bc9b5d504e,oh man i like this build 
4863.0,6ff331afcc80841e531ce07b19d46c95cd0ae96e,not only had cav but cavalier and clarion twice 
4876.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,the planeswalkers also help taht i can only do 2 things a turn thing 
4878.0,2103583b7bb3de8ccac8b6132289670bcb6aa2ea,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238 it looks like the 75 that was in the latest modo decklists you can check it out there 
4886.0,2e02787571237bf88d855219b8ca7e2b70cb2b7d,i still think the fires deck is to reliant on drawing fires and as such probably will never be as consistent as other decks in the format 
4897.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,2103583b7bb3de8ccac8b6132289670bcb6aa2ea oh that's out 
4899.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,awesome 
4901.0,ce62dc8ad5ac8350ab95b0459a109aa9edebd6fc,waiting to see if they are playin kenny 
4903.0,bed224798bdc2e9558545290c94bb2bc9b5d504e,they keep getting free dig through times are we really in it 
4906.0,2cf6df038d10c96cb916f12066b4965de1075a27,alright heading out now have a good day jeff and chat gl hf 
4908.0,1e54f77adef029c64156db605669c84c59738d7f,is it worth just biting the bullet and hitting fires now 
4908.0,9406576192ebdf0777deee2565cac2f2097a3f32,mans how can they have all this fire and still have fish 
4930.0,9eab04d3183c1c73c23a8d7f3e8e7eee03b97924,the opponent is currently playing champions 
4945.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,hearthstone is probably the biggest downside of their deck 
4945.0,bed224798bdc2e9558545290c94bb2bc9b5d504e,you think cav is their only wincon 
4946.0,d79e7635aeeed71e724ab961b7611daf88888c61,it would be good with a stasis type effect if that existed in standard 
4949.0,1df9c0d6612bc4603f971c45054964d3b195775d,inb4 cav+illharg+end-raze 
4952.0,cdd886e9628334f85d9be4e03aa8fec22ef813cd,8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f i'm looking to get new sleeves for a cube do you suggest the bcw elite 2 or double matte sleeves 
4964.0,7b02d88ed9a67b97086bd6c8dd1b58543715550b,their end-goal is often wish for command but they seem to dig for cavalier deeply 
4979.0,9eab04d3183c1c73c23a8d7f3e8e7eee03b97924,so we can now play hearthstone champions or sometimes even magic while playing arena now 
4982.0,9406576192ebdf0777deee2565cac2f2097a3f32,fires 
5020.0,bed224798bdc2e9558545290c94bb2bc9b5d504e,why not pump to 3 there 
5057.0,b6e6448e3e3f9f4b45419e0210e5752448c93de7,i mean this looks like a better use of fires than the grixis decks i keep seeing at least this one has some mana sinks that are useful 
5061.0,60f8a8dd49535de71e810e729f77cdf71fe22f52,what a weird game this has been 
5072.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,b6e6448e3e3f9f4b45419e0210e5752448c93de7 believe it or not but grixis is still unplayable 
5072.0,8a877dfa60d7ea9701d4f4d221fd1ce49c0ca4c5,anyone finding good buddies for rankle i've been testing him with fenlurker 
5076.0,bed224798bdc2e9558545290c94bb2bc9b5d504e,maybe they probably have 6ana chandra or sarkhan on top of the cavs right 
5077.0,9939832215a84d20495acaa76d196481ffe6324e,bed224798bdc2e9558545290c94bb2bc9b5d504e maybe they want to hold up executioner mana 
5104.0,bd0420f5efafa130901e9db8f8deeaf717e87523,kenrith seems like it might be a cool sink too 
5104.0,6ff331afcc80841e531ce07b19d46c95cd0ae96e,executioner is still just a 1 for 1 
5106.0,5fb4d3fb1a272c85e14980ca98a3df0cca162c05,and you can use its pump effect for no downside 
5110.0,b8d144e8833ea61e9253028d7a75847c020a96ce,8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f haven't been able to check in since eldraine dropped what are your initial reactions to the set/meta so far 
5110.0,dbfaf95b8df4dfbf282d4a82e8440ef996598822,if they lose this then im not sure how their deck ever wins 
5115.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,ok so they can bounce their fires 
5118.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,that's kinda sweet 
5119.0,a8661c4b3eca2c25dfaa7cf9e941846405c15f58,fires of invention is everywhere for me 
5125.0,5fb4d3fb1a272c85e14980ca98a3df0cca162c05,executioner keeps a 1/1 on the field so its by definition a 2 for 1 
5132.0,c9cad53872c3171fa90529fd8652b61624a8f928,8a877dfa60d7ea9701d4f4d221fd1ce49c0ca4c5 could try cauldron familiar with witch's oven 
5138.0,60f8a8dd49535de71e810e729f77cdf71fe22f52,is that cav #4 
5143.0,dbfaf95b8df4dfbf282d4a82e8440ef996598822,well thats the last cav 
5154.0,d79e7635aeeed71e724ab961b7611daf88888c61,is opponent playing alliance 
5156.0,ba9062e2e0d5e91a7821f4d74a7a6c5bab32f67a,they've been digging a lot 
5166.0,2e02787571237bf88d855219b8ca7e2b70cb2b7d,how much of their deck is left 
5171.0,84a69a5a9e99a5b424444b5f41f0e44604e0519a,well now 
5172.0,5fb4d3fb1a272c85e14980ca98a3df0cca162c05,alliance does not work in fires of intervention tbh 
5188.0,bed224798bdc2e9558545290c94bb2bc9b5d504e,goose wolf fight double eat 
5200.0,bed224798bdc2e9558545290c94bb2bc9b5d504e,nice

5223.0,995e38a592db336a5114f6e051a4788e15727766,wolf is going to be so annoying this season 
5226.0,7bd484a31a8fe78b91fed48bf10f49a0257950ea,how many cards are left in their lib 
5228.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,wait this is still game one i took a phone call and assumed we died 
5229.0,84a69a5a9e99a5b424444b5f41f0e44604e0519a,oh wow those counters are permanent--- goodness 
5234.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,opt seems awful in their deck 
5234.0,2e02787571237bf88d855219b8ca7e2b70cb2b7d,what top end cards do they have left if they have used all their cav's 
5235.0,921634f708c44718d98602e47cf00e771589145b,they must know their entire deck order by now 
5242.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,i have yet to see a fires deck that seems good 
5242.0,0de1e04f198e8ec601762a8d5432d847bb047772,when is the new modern faerie deck coming 
5243.0,60f8a8dd49535de71e810e729f77cdf71fe22f52,everything = 4 cavaliers 
5245.0,dbfaf95b8df4dfbf282d4a82e8440ef996598822,whoa 
5247.0,62990b50ac5858808b69ba03a552fee561cfdaba,we're in a pretty good spot even 
5252.0,5fb4d3fb1a272c85e14980ca98a3df0cca162c05,why not run tamiyo's ephiany instead of shimmer of possibility 
5252.0,dbfaf95b8df4dfbf282d4a82e8440ef996598822,didnt even play their second card 
5256.0,5fb4d3fb1a272c85e14980ca98a3df0cca162c05,seems kinda meh 
5256.0,ba9062e2e0d5e91a7821f4d74a7a6c5bab32f67a,i don't like opt in their build this is too much durdling from them now i think 
5257.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,if they lose they should pitch their deck into a dumpster 
5258.0,bed224798bdc2e9558545290c94bb2bc9b5d504e,and they are digging for a secondary wincon 
5264.0,7b02d88ed9a67b97086bd6c8dd1b58543715550b,they lifelinked once or twice with the massive cavs too 
5276.0,f7a082a7801bf9277d169204f1b380d3905629b1,i think these fires decks need a cruel ultimatum style card to just close out the game 
5279.0,06e6a9a979464ac9d79db1aa7b7e435ffcbdd514,make a token 
5281.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,they gained 15ish life iirc 
5285.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,f7a082a7801bf9277d169204f1b380d3905629b1 that card is fae of wishes 
5314.0,0de1e04f198e8ec601762a8d5432d847bb047772,jeff i know this is standard time but when are you playing a new faerie modern deck 
5335.0,cdd886e9628334f85d9be4e03aa8fec22ef813cd,why would making food on your turn be better 
5351.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,0de1e04f198e8ec601762a8d5432d847bb047772 i think that is about how much democracy he gest 
5353.0,5ac2192923afe4c3bdcd3637ef0ece4f0dc0f238,gets 
5356.0,921634f708c44718d98602e47cf00e771589145b,have you thought of dreadhorde invasion for this deck for oko or is that interaction not good enough 
5360.0,5fb4d3fb1a272c85e14980ca98a3df0cca162c05,is faerie vandal not abusable 
5367.0,1e37794f7b4bbf13f0df17021447c6b0286674ef,i am fed up again played 3 times in 5 matches vs lil tef and htey always had 3 of them 
5368.0,a65367b83d37ecce810d81aaa3728da156b22b6a,i've been able to out grind fires decks with both field of the dead decks and with jund adventures obviously we haven't seen the best possible fires list yet but it feels like a deck that wants to get to the very late game but can't always win when it does 
5375.0,0de1e04f198e8ec601762a8d5432d847bb047772,the 3/1 flash flyer that bounces seems good maybe im overating it though 
5378.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,just crack your clue and draw a card kappa 
5389.0,d497bda8691f4e06b7850c62940791a9d0d0aeab,maybe they don't have any win conditions left 
5390.0,ce62dc8ad5ac8350ab95b0459a109aa9edebd6fc,921634f708c44718d98602e47cf00e771589145b think it was played already seemed fun but life totals were rough 
5392.0,6ff331afcc80841e531ce07b19d46c95cd0ae96e,you flooded pretty hard 
5400.0,c21071f827218f02835faa42ececd124528831f2,it's greedy but without the ali level of payoff 
5407.0,62990b50ac5858808b69ba03a552fee561cfdaba,their deck just gets destroyed by field decks it seems 
5408.0,2e02787571237bf88d855219b8ca7e2b70cb2b7d,you seem to have a couple of turns to find an answer to that 1/1 
5410.0,a9929cc54118e516f2fd4e49d8689af376b2c97f,he drew a lot of cards now he just has to put something good in his deck to draw 
5418.0,bed224798bdc2e9558545290c94bb2bc9b5d504e,we were at 4 lands for a while

13508.0,14963b60254e0d68a0fb8e5b2d4efac762030cb2,stax is named after the card smokestacks and is based around resource denial 
13512.0,2103583b7bb3de8ccac8b6132289670bcb6aa2ea,stax needs rankle and that enchantment to be closer to actual stax but even then it's probably more akin to smallpox 
13518.0,5fb4d3fb1a272c85e14980ca98a3df0cca162c05,if they want lands to be isolated effect wise from the rest of the game then field of the dead cards should be much weaker
