1140.0,6e3d25b9d5d71f6e01a6b84dc856664c51f9aad7,if you have 4 treb in a siege you basicly cant lose

1195.0,73a24396f7cb75e9c4cefaddb1ae10a1cff0f4c8,i find i prefer the yellow turbans especially he yi because he seems to be a beast in the early game

1252.0,73a24396f7cb75e9c4cefaddb1ae10a1cff0f4c8,like i think he loses to yuan shao and he's obviously not able to take on lu bu but he seems to just wreck most generals around him in duels and in just beating up units 
1254.0,2e181238e1a98f8f8e32f1906a20cb0bbec53abe,lol u guys are still talking about hero power levels

1389.0,73a24396f7cb75e9c4cefaddb1ae10a1cff0f4c8,i feel that yuan shao is probably going to be reworked more than nerfed 
1406.0,33e4d8a9da7cc7583f8b1c599161bb7c2e42d25e,think i am gonna ditch this save literally every single faction is super pissed at me and im at war with every neighboer all this because they all attacked my vassal(s while i had non-aggression pacts with them now its just defend against waves of 10 armies invaing me an they never seem to end or even if i kill 5 of their armies peace is never an option

2189.0,73a24396f7cb75e9c4cefaddb1ae10a1cff0f4c8,i prefer romance because it feels more fun and its more forgiving of mistakes as long as your mistake wasn't to pursue lu bu

2360.0,73a24396f7cb75e9c4cefaddb1ae10a1cff0f4c8,yes 
2360.0,182151a01452ee2439862ac94e86c9d0efd4321f,no you plainly just put an bolt into the slot and fire

2395.0,777878c9bddb507aa0849dda37b65bb410332749,a bow is 4 aimed shots per minute vs xbow is 2 
2400.0,9abfb5a8860d888a0f2b57c015a53b43af3170f5,in case you are interested he is yun as in u-n 
2403.0,182151a01452ee2439862ac94e86c9d0efd4321f,harder then you would think y but not as hard as ppl think either 
2404.0,73a24396f7cb75e9c4cefaddb1ae10a1cff0f4c8,winding a crossbow is difficult and some models of crossbow can misfire while loading and kill the user 
2414.0,73a24396f7cb75e9c4cefaddb1ae10a1cff0f4c8,historical crossbows 
2417.0,182151a01452ee2439862ac94e86c9d0efd4321f,its hard to pull tho

2450.0,73a24396f7cb75e9c4cefaddb1ae10a1cff0f4c8,it does depend and later crossbows got so powerful that it became time consuming 
2459.0,e3e1e348c0cf4f401b6d9e0fb61c36d916dcd89b,i just assumed crossbows would be slower due to the cranks ect to pull the string back to launch the bolt but eh 
2466.0,3891c0be7d6ddde9d6a3d90ba3c337a6feded211,what do the hearts mean 
2478.0,5eaa419aff6c4519a11af9a295573d1eee88f3f4,crossbows were popular because they required very little training compared to a bow to be used 
2493.0,f6a7cc9898defac37eb88cbad98ae8a85f1dfcd9,you know that there was a cross bow in ancient china you would fire lying down on your back and span it with your legs 
2502.0,5eaa419aff6c4519a11af9a295573d1eee88f3f4,same was true of early firearms as well 
2514.0,73a24396f7cb75e9c4cefaddb1ae10a1cff0f4c8,so fact: historically crossbow users worked in pairs the senior would aim and fire

2612.0,73a24396f7cb75e9c4cefaddb1ae10a1cff0f4c8,long bows required a life time of training to use with precision but as the english proved against the french its super easy to train peasants to fire volleys in fixed ranges
