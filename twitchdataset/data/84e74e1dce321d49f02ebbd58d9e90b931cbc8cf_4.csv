720.0,e31e81ba0836837abca7b0cbd54b6414f525a83d,maru has really good micro and cheeses but serral is better than maru at a macro game 
722.0,24c60c35f04290c65d803dcf12a9f8ff8a0ae3d8,maru is an incredible player with a long history of great playing but saying he's better than serral or even that it's arguable given recent results that's denial 
722.0,98620affc1ae84624e9e5df43106d9381986114e,85d5347a71b8647845645a268754c620c9ed52be considering he beat every korean he played between late march 2018 to early march 2019 i'd say the same 
725.0,4c447f9de98ef79041ee6a220f1b28191d0bf0bc,the problem with serral is that the competition in europe is probably not on par with the korean one 
725.0,d26a8671b2a78bef936b3242db6ee97aea3fa5c8,they're both amazing players

765.0,85d5347a71b8647845645a268754c620c9ed52be,marus recent results you mean 4 gsl titles in a row those are hard results to argue with 
769.0,98620affc1ae84624e9e5df43106d9381986114e,gsl vs the world homestory cup blizzcon etc 
771.0,d26a8671b2a78bef936b3242db6ee97aea3fa5c8,people pretending that serral doesn't compete against koreans in tournaments throughout the year lul 
776.0,24c60c35f04290c65d803dcf12a9f8ff8a0ae3d8,that's not a problem when he shows up to an international or korean tournament and the results are the same 4c447f9de98ef79041ee6a220f1b28191d0bf0bc 
782.0,91bab1c3d71cb9e4d8f459ec61683227870d8165,maru has a lot of early exits in tournaments while 3 of those gsl are not recent 
806.0,85d5347a71b8647845645a268754c620c9ed52be,literally 4 out of the last 5 gels how is that not recent because he didn't do it a week ago

842.0,85d5347a71b8647845645a268754c620c9ed52be,so everything serial did a year ago shouldn't be talked about either then

854.0,d26a8671b2a78bef936b3242db6ee97aea3fa5c8,if you want to see the matchup cheer for maru so he doesn't get knocked out so early in these tournaments :p 
854.0,e31e81ba0836837abca7b0cbd54b6414f525a83d,serral did well at iem and just barely lost to the champion soo but serral walked over his group at iem with ease and there were koreans in his group
