17021.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,speaking of thsoe games man they could do a lot with them 
17044.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,one for each major faction at min 
17073.0,516314e47351ea7aba34bbe013eb7fdecfe8c55b,10 years later finally the first turn has ended 
17088.0,93c2b8b09dc742b0f97bf46a90593780dca08f6d,the time one late game turn would take 
17106.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,i just want to see them controlled by people and not stupid ai

17212.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,so many major events that happened 
17219.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,heck playing as aenarion the defender could be neat 
17241.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,can you hold off the hordes of endless daemons long enough for caledor the dragontamer to do his stuff 
17251.0,38cd021c91109ac4b70a4dc5b6a8761c7e6275c3,another studio will get the rights to a strategy game based on warhammer eventually and you'll get a different game out of it generous workshop doesn't have permanent business partners 
17291.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,i'm actually surprised someone hasn't made custom sundering campaign or war of the beard mod yet 
17294.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,i love warhammer too 
17360.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,what do those shadows exactly mean grimith ambush fight between ai 
17362.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,to this day i still don't forgive the the old ceo and board of directors for what they did 
17372.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,but they got their dues when tehy all got fired 
17421.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,and they said warhammer fantasy couldn't sell 
17430.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,the tww games and vermintide proved them dead fucking wrong 
17431.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,i see thank you 
17482.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155 yep now the age of sigmar thing with their hieratic face masks 
17485.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,i dont know 
17493.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,not my thing i guess 
17520.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,age of sigmar is reskinned 40k 
17525.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,look up the imolith deep ones 
17532.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,they're basically reskinned dark eldar 
17543.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,yeah thats what i mean 
17546.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,sigmar's faction has basically become fantasy imperium of man 
17546.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,why they did that 
17558.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,i liked the old thing 
17573.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,because under the old boards and ceo's logic 40k was selling and whf wasn't 
17580.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,and the new board was left having to do something 
17586.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,so they moved forward with age of sigmar 
17598.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,issue is they didn't put in any effort to advertise whf 
17601.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,at all 
17608.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,they could do smthing better than dow 3 instead of that xd 
17621.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,well we speaking about books but still 
17631.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,i love realmslayer 
17635.0,93c2b8b09dc742b0f97bf46a90593780dca08f6d,latest warhammer fantasy rpg ignores aos 
17650.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,the rpg is weird 
17655.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,it has shit like magic using dwarfs 
17663.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,that don't turn to stone from using magic 
17678.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,because gotreks basically embodies the most whf fanbase's opinion on aos 
17681.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,ie we all hate it 
17784.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,honestly i don't want them to bring back whf until they realize people don't want a 40k clone 
17790.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,because tehy were turning whf into that 
17811.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,see the high elves having not soulstones in 8th edition 
17812.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,yeah 
17816.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,that was fcking stupid 
17825.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,fantasy and 40k were perfect on their own 
17829.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,yup 
17837.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,the old board was stuipd 
17861.0,38cd021c91109ac4b70a4dc5b6a8761c7e6275c3,if you're waiting for wfb to come back don't expect it to be a mainline gw game it'll do the rounds as a specialist game or whatever with models from forge world 
17881.0,93c2b8b09dc742b0f97bf46a90593780dca08f6d,i dunno about magic using dawi since they are blocked from starting with any class that has anything to do with magic 
17890.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,the tww games have done really really well 
17901.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,people were actually ready to get into whf fantasy proper 
17907.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,and then found that gw had canned the setting 
17912.0,38cd021c91109ac4b70a4dc5b6a8761c7e6275c3,different market though 
17934.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,yeah the many mods the fans made to turn the game into warhammer was a good indicator 
17940.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,and someone was smart enough to do the math 
17941.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,yup 
17969.0,38cd021c91109ac4b70a4dc5b6a8761c7e6275c3,the gw store is a place for boys to get into the hobby so gw wants it full of models for that demographic wfb appeals more to an older crowd 
17984.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,not really 
17990.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,how old do you think i am 
18001.0,38cd021c91109ac4b70a4dc5b6a8761c7e6275c3,i figure you're older than 12 
18024.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,i am but you think aos or 40k will appeal to kids more 
18035.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,i actually first learned about whf at about that age 
18040.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,via the books 
18053.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,and got into it 
18054.0,93c2b8b09dc742b0f97bf46a90593780dca08f6d,yeah checked it and careers that have magic are restricted to other races dwarves can't access to them 
18061.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,gnomes 
18063.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,me too 
18066.0,38cd021c91109ac4b70a4dc5b6a8761c7e6275c3,40k definitely sells well to kids space marines are easy to paint 
18068.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,gnomes are magic using dwarfs 
18073.0,93c2b8b09dc742b0f97bf46a90593780dca08f6d,that was true in 2e and 4e rpg 
18098.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,anyway 
18103.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,i on't know if aos is selling well then good move otherwise big fuck up 
18104.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,issue with whf is no one advertised it 
18109.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,it's not 
18111.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,well 
18111.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,that's what i mean 
18112.0,93c2b8b09dc742b0f97bf46a90593780dca08f6d,so don't know where the notion of magic using dwarves came 
18117.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,gnomes 
18121.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,that will tell us about what kids like more 
18133.0,02b0fb6853f9c4ff35cc986d7419898eb9592741,i personally love the old thing both of them as they were 
18137.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,they're explicitly magic using dwarfs 
18147.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,i used to like 40k 
18154.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,but then the grimderp killed my interest 
18154.0,93c2b8b09dc742b0f97bf46a90593780dca08f6d,what gnomes 
18171.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,they're a race in 1e and 4e 
18183.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,they're shadow magic using dwarfs 
18206.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,hence my statement about the rpg having weird shit 
18214.0,93c2b8b09dc742b0f97bf46a90593780dca08f6d,i haven't seen any mention of them in rulebook 
18229.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,my friends that checked out 4e told me gnomes are back 
18236.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,so they're in one of the books for it 
18258.0,93c2b8b09dc742b0f97bf46a90593780dca08f6d,there was chaos dwarves that used magic but they are quite different 
18265.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,yup 
18270.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,i loved the whf setting tho 
18277.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,the empire was one of my least favorite settings 
18284.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,and this is from someone that liked all of them but chaos 
18346.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,i also mourn the fact cathey indy and nippon never got proper lore books 
18380.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,or army books 
18446.0,38cd021c91109ac4b70a4dc5b6a8761c7e6275c3,the warhammer armies project guy put together books for those factions 
18617.0,516314e47351ea7aba34bbe013eb7fdecfe8c55b,liu bei doesn't have the peach grove oath with kong rong this run 
18943.0,19f1810c2b162c1dff5243c41e22a6b43b4bf155,neat
