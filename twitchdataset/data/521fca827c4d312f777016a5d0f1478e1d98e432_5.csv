293.0,77a8ec17c4c37be324a677a3d10365c186222fe4,b9c7a5c930d82d9c426b8e5e56452d3e1c1b4d71 lithe is a better perk than both dead hard and sprint burst you can combo it with dance with me and the killer is lost a lot of times 
297.0,a4e8325dcc82089047b85a6e20cd2351c6528f92,it gives you crazy distance if you get the killer to whiff 
298.0,784b607fca2ca0c232aaa4a83131704a796d3186,594aa70ae882888d03068a01e1ad6c51ea6ba6da ty hxyh 
303.0,057ca1c5a383ccec77f37e420aaeed98565c6e42,you can mask sb if you let it fill up and use it right before it recharges then you bait the killer tap sprint boom you're fucking gone it dominates dh which is easy to bait out of 99% of survivors 
305.0,c8c87eacc987d1fb0be61cc19104b3913d39371b,my point with all the argument is that both are good perks but imo dh can be more valuable in the hands of good survivors that actually know how to use it 
307.0,46abdf43f04300ba0634d58f2a9e862e8c4a7d66,dh is not super situational it is situational but it's not that drastic

356.0,e69cfe34a147b46df9dceacf1502775fdae3b313,i think the issue with dh is that it's most versatile exhaustion perk you can use it in most every situation so a lot of people run it but don't even know how to use it properly 
360.0,82156de5fe0ab14a25ea2b00f2fca29f1829b8e2,sprint burst is also good for getting away from the hook with a campy killer
