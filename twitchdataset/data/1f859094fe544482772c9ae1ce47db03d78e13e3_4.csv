15.0,cfc8c926cebab14da9b163d7371bd4b4a791c0f8,thus making it impossible for your opponent to tell if the card you played is the tracked card or another one 
16.0,4e5f58c9738e6dc89685a112fe1f5929fbbaca07,does that still work if you have the same card with two different artworks

3748.0,1957a7263aa15851ba44fb845c8cf7454a8a4417,being able to last hit while under pressure requires a lot of skill though makes the game deeper and thus more enjoyjable

3755.0,ef0afd73fa7657f60d86b5ada37173d3fccb81f6,randomino5 it gives a bit of strategy to what in hots is just mindless sponge-roleplay 
3763.0,3247244b5d7ea81f7116c830ddf71ffcbb8e6551,i will ahppily speak for sean and all of chat last hitting is bad it should feel bad and should go away to ets land fill

3774.0,353cec7e1fc1b99ecbb84ff8eb62da25708e50cd,last hitting introduces some really interesting interaction in the laning phase where you can push them off of their creeps just a bit and deny farm 
3778.0,afd5cd3402ff95787b51f9b9aacd44954a618838,in another word its unintuitive 
3779.0,ae7bb24e18bbd001444ab509cc128a433c9efacc,if we only made games that we're elegant we would miss out on a lot of cool games 
3807.0,0285fffec8163998c6b4aa078aafe53899879904,it's hard to think of it in a negative way given i've been playing dota for ~15 years now

3815.0,1957a7263aa15851ba44fb845c8cf7454a8a4417,taking last hitting out of moba games is the same as taking micro out of strategy games 
3817.0,762becef125211ead940627a2eff7a0f29eba246,crying is always the answer 
3836.0,d741c841a172040d0a7b71d1ad5048762e94634c,i think we just cry - basically my solution to all things 
3836.0,1f3f15370c118e082bad2ef2287e5b5469686dc0,is there a way to be as complicated as dota and be elegant

4146.0,20f84f86d60e426d071054137bdf7d30cb94ede9,lol those recipes make auto chess the most confusingly incongruent experience 
4149.0,6790e8ee1be10027b8980f61d61331d013c130e4,can someone tell me how to get wood to build mekanism

4179.0,01608e1be08a57e93b73cb059b0ade99f50dda64,i hate thought erasure more than any other card it's like here's all the info of the cards in hand and you can take away a key tool but also you can scry because we made it two colors i guess by the way we the design team absolutely hate fun 
4184.0,7f0297c050e3c847efc2a2055dc53b77ec9e1119,does this deck consist of mostly land 
4202.0,1e9f5a95e1f7c00cc8ccff3c610adf55fdcbe41d,wqit thats news to me you share courier now 
4203.0,20f84f86d60e426d071054137bdf7d30cb94ede9,elegence is when the complexity matches your intuitive understanding of the game 
4211.0,51e583bdb69170d89ae6e6cfe00d520dfcc1d06d,01608e1be08a57e93b73cb059b0ade99f50dda64 sounds like you just hate dimir then lol 
4217.0,1f3f15370c118e082bad2ef2287e5b5469686dc0,more like: how many rules do you need to memorize to be good at the game 
4224.0,f1987a0405d0ff961ce0f3b2fd54c7573817ac6c,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 because the original dota was made by a bunch of random modders and the mechanics are still around 
4226.0,01608e1be08a57e93b73cb059b0ade99f50dda64,51e583bdb69170d89ae6e6cfe00d520dfcc1d06d you're not wrong 
4233.0,6790e8ee1be10027b8980f61d61331d013c130e4,yeah nothing in dota makes fucking sense it's awesome it is the best game but my god it's so fucking insane 
4240.0,d2bf3456a63a9e551c67421deecc51c376adb90e,lots of small mini-games that play into the larger game as a whole but have no immediate connection to a newcomer essentially 
4256.0,df8335c8f0e232512407f44cf8082b491719281f,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 i feel like a lot of mobas still haven't left behind their origins as rts custom maps things that are janky in the design feel like the kinds of things you had to do to make it work in the wc3 map maker but i've only played the genre very casually so i'm not 100% on this 
4256.0,1d83c1a422d22755c4dfd11d0161c7a154fe528a,f1987a0405d0ff961ce0f3b2fd54c7573817ac6c 1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 it's not even that the mechanics are old - its that they were bugs that stuck 
4258.0,2b638d4aa4ed948feae9adf3e3555724d1276d78,those are all mechanics from the wc3 days that were never revisited they were all bound to the trigger condition of the map editor for the camp: every minute if no enemies are present for player neutral respawn the camp 
4258.0,20b1e079ac3fa00e81e64f92614186ff0e40e082,its all about intuitive rules vs contrived ones 
4261.0,1f3f15370c118e082bad2ef2287e5b5469686dc0,go is simple and deep dota is complicated and deep 
4285.0,3fd290dc1c23dbab12c1c712f218f957c7862ae9,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 btw i was trying to get your attention during our game cause you actually said you had kaya's wrath out loud one turn 
4288.0,6790e8ee1be10027b8980f61d61331d013c130e4,or like another example why the fuck does roshan give those different things each time you kill him 
4290.0,a41691044c124d3943f1d505d9e3e271ab15d938,1e9f5a95e1f7c00cc8ccff3c610adf55fdcbe41d y quite common at some ti games just a matter of time since we the plebs of pubs will enjoy this new mechanic daysick dayderp 
4299.0,3fd290dc1c23dbab12c1c712f218f957c7862ae9,luckily it didn't change my game decision but i woulda felt bad if it did 
4303.0,6790e8ee1be10027b8980f61d61331d013c130e4,and like why does the aegis expire 
4307.0,94541f5c7695262f5f5a8d6a5a299b001478c9de,in board games it's usually referred to as how thematic the game is how much the mechanics feel like what is being abstracted in game 
4316.0,cd9dec927b271b378f6c95db339f94b210f2fd31,so i just got into a game playing mill opponent has 250 card deck help 
4319.0,1d83c1a422d22755c4dfd11d0161c7a154fe528a,i mean - dota2 is wildly inelegant - it wasn't designed it evolved 
4326.0,e5ff5736fe562f59386e4b81e932205620a8e2c4,what do you feel are the consequences of elegance verses inelequence then 
4327.0,a1114a79bf878298e0f68c2df76c8622ea4fb92a,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 do you think theme and implementation of said theme has more of a role in elegance than we think 
4336.0,9ee2c7947b0d89803cc2ac70d4935533741fe535,another drakes deck huh 
4344.0,6790e8ee1be10027b8980f61d61331d013c130e4,cd9dec927b271b378f6c95db339f94b210f2fd31 just win duh

4370.0,f1987a0405d0ff961ce0f3b2fd54c7573817ac6c,yeah booting up dota for the first time without a coach of some sort is like tying cinderblocks for your first swimming lesson you're going to drown 
4382.0,3247244b5d7ea81f7116c830ddf71ffcbb8e6551,you lose teferi to shock with this line its jsut which you prefer

4411.0,d2bf3456a63a9e551c67421deecc51c376adb90e,my friend who taught us dota did a hell of a job teaching us from the ground up and enabling us to just do enough stuff until we got the hang of it 
4411.0,e5ff5736fe562f59386e4b81e932205620a8e2c4,he doesn't play direct games with chat

4413.0,14865077e7b19d2249244969cf82ac26f54952d0,ok thanks e5ff5736fe562f59386e4b81e932205620a8e2c4

4468.0,100f16d58261f135c1ba450056e0f7ba07160f4b,my issue with getting back into magic and hs for that matter has been understanding how my decks interface with the current meta 
4470.0,20f84f86d60e426d071054137bdf7d30cb94ede9,the key is that you make tradeoffs like that consciously right the takeaway as a designer is that you can't just say i think this is fun and put it in your game you have to consider whether its inclusion is worth it 
4483.0,06c943c286042eee1e71fad3b27c434694951013,monster hunter world is beautiful 
4489.0,100f16d58261f135c1ba450056e0f7ba07160f4b,the game is already complicated and understanding meta components make it harder 
4498.0,6790e8ee1be10027b8980f61d61331d013c130e4,b7046f5acfe86905a29fabe2052ac6934ae24caa it really is inelegant why is it in that one box why not make it so that the monsters only respawn once they are killed look at the league jungle vs the dota jungle 
4498.0,fcf1501b786bf417c101d59f0ef16d6f2ad3459d,i completely agree 
4502.0,f7b3dc9d361f936afffa3a8f9038df3ede25d34c,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 go is an elegant game relatively simple -- but quite hard am i on the same page as you

4524.0,3fd290dc1c23dbab12c1c712f218f957c7862ae9,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 the only thing dota 2 needs to fix is the community in solo queue if i don't have a party to play with i just don't get enjoyment out of it anymore

4556.0,9ee2c7947b0d89803cc2ac70d4935533741fe535,i really liked the subnautica gdc presentation where they talk about not being afraid to lose some part of their audience by capitalizing on what makes their game good 
4573.0,afd5cd3402ff95787b51f9b9aacd44954a618838,3fd290dc1c23dbab12c1c712f218f957c7862ae9 good luck fixing the community of a f2p moba game 
4573.0,af3bb454b222121c5d502d21cfc30c86a4e1d642,that actually makes me think about wow over the years they made it more and more accessible which made it less enjoyable for me personally 
4574.0,100f16d58261f135c1ba450056e0f7ba07160f4b,what's really interesting 1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 is that even go has a meta- old pros vs new pro openings hot new shapes etc 
4579.0,d2bf3456a63a9e551c67421deecc51c376adb90e,b7046f5acfe86905a29fabe2052ac6934ae24caa i think day9 might be using inelegant as a way to describe the lack of immediate connection as to how stacking correlates to the purpose of the game: to push the towers we know it's to expedite farm for a carry to allow for pushing but that's not the most immediate connection people might make if they were new to the game i'm thinking that's what he means by inelegant 
4591.0,abc904e44699d03aa4c028229097041ba406de9c,go is such an amazing game i love it 
4603.0,1d83c1a422d22755c4dfd11d0161c7a154fe528a,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 so elegance is the # of rules inputs? and complexity is the # of states that evolve out of that 
4622.0,5af13a1b6293803147d9eaefed67063fbab05d18,1d83c1a422d22755c4dfd11d0161c7a154fe528a i really like that explanation 
4633.0,140ff149cfe3d9dddbb0893207bdda8ca2fdfd22,mark rosewater developer of magic talks a lot about accessibility he intentionally designs magic cards to have a high skill ceiling but a relatively obvious low skill floor he calls it lenticular design 
4637.0,9ee2c7947b0d89803cc2ac70d4935533741fe535,isn't it simply the notion that excluding groups of customers must inevitably be bad 
4655.0,3de8509f6c6ec28cc85fc0213866f476bc75cd23,i think the thing about accessability is that a lot of times designers use it in a different way than the community the community wants disability accssability and designers have a tendancy to just mean simplicity 
4657.0,f7b3dc9d361f936afffa3a8f9038df3ede25d34c,guys keep in mind the difference between starcraft and total war franchise when you think about complexity starcraft is much less complex 
4658.0,1e9f5a95e1f7c00cc8ccff3c610adf55fdcbe41d,wasnt mobile games the most profitable by far 
4659.0,b7046f5acfe86905a29fabe2052ac6934ae24caa,the box is an artifact of the old wc3 editor the essene of stacking seems elegant to me

4674.0,6790e8ee1be10027b8980f61d61331d013c130e4,sometimes a more accessible game just isn't as interesting

4811.0,b7046f5acfe86905a29fabe2052ac6934ae24caa,d42f663ca859344f6aa5ede27adaa7c6c6d5c3e7 i see it theother way around the camps are graphically pretty well defined they used to be anyway then the camps were used to balance once stacking was discovered the essene of camps respawn when empty seems pretty elegant 
4817.0,f58305e532ec9e7f8bb9035dab65d965c8ac03d9,it's been interesting to see with mobile games that they are complex lots of different in game currency leveling and skills etc of course this is to sell stuff but they are still lots of components

4843.0,6790e8ee1be10027b8980f61d61331d013c130e4,think of elegance/inelegance as the amount of times you explain something to someone in a game and their response is either oh yeah that makes sense vs why the fuck would that be the case? essentially how many times you have to say you're just going to have to accept this and move on 
4850.0,3bfd9b8ef6839365abb480af7e6bcad7dfbfef73,needs more kaya's wrath

4863.0,ef0afd73fa7657f60d86b5ada37173d3fccb81f6,i'd argue wavedashing is far more inelegant dodging into the floor gives you super speed like what 
4869.0,1d83c1a422d22755c4dfd11d0161c7a154fe528a,d2bf3456a63a9e551c67421deecc51c376adb90e stacking is a wierd mechanic - but it wasn't designed into the game - it was a bug/implementation requirement of dota 1 
4872.0,bf56faebf5588c55999c53a6fdf1d243e81867ad,the reliance on marketing for games nowadays is so weird to me like for it to be so much of a budget dedicated to marketing and for that to be a good decision feels like something is wrong but i don't know how the system would change to facilitate less focus on marketing 
4875.0,90dd871530bc0dfbf597284138049b848fc33f0c,the opponent kind of conceded in a weird spot that first game

4891.0,1f3f15370c118e082bad2ef2287e5b5469686dc0,english is inelegant based on the number of times i have to say you're just going to have to accept this and move on to non-native speakers

5047.0,ef0afd73fa7657f60d86b5ada37173d3fccb81f6,grimcoyote i disagree on that point stacking camps allows your carry to save time and kill multiple waves at once and since the last hit model generally funnels gold into a few players it's pretty obvious to me

5153.0,f1987a0405d0ff961ce0f3b2fd54c7573817ac6c,the game is so much faster than dota you have to be on your feet for macro more quickly i think

5189.0,abc904e44699d03aa4c028229097041ba406de9c,creep deny adds a level of attention that i just don't have for the game 
5189.0,3fd290dc1c23dbab12c1c712f218f957c7862ae9,i don't think that denying creeps even happens in pubs when you first start playing the game

5203.0,1f3f15370c118e082bad2ef2287e5b5469686dc0,denying just exists to keep you from being bored during early game laning 
5207.0,12128b9635baa3326cc33b66d4706a048af94d20,i agree 1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 that is a category mistake to say league is more accessible

5222.0,b393df16ea6ab45ead0ec0e4c50d5b94722ce82e,but i think the visual clearity in league is mostly better than dota 
5230.0,2569ca015a82d3c15b8b2fc7a30c1a96a142cd1e,i think moba communities are #1 cause of inaccessibility> the first time i played dota the people had such toxic personalities i didn't play again for two years 
5234.0,d2bf3456a63a9e551c67421deecc51c376adb90e,the lack of denying in lol threw me for such a loop it's definitely something that adds a layer of depth to laning but at 1k who even thinks about that when you're rushing that divine boi 
5234.0,ef0afd73fa7657f60d86b5ada37173d3fccb81f6,having dabbled in lol my only concern with enemies as a new player was don't die rooshrug

5267.0,d669856d9a4c6e8b231d6fc85d605e4a314f6acf,the biggest barrier-to-learn for dota and lol in my opinion is last-hitting dota's shop takes a bit more effort but is very doable to learn if you can push past last-hitting
