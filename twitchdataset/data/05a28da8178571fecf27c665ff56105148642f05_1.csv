4711.0,5aea5a285545be5dc31353b84b5f93a5213abf46,well there is a exception to the rule of red bared enemies if they use fire then they are imune to fire and in this case either go non elenmental oorrosive or cryo would be your best bet 
4720.0,725de843e67eb1820aa4ef05775b629d7a371ce6,i'd resist being shot in the butt tbh 
4744.0,5aea5a285545be5dc31353b84b5f93a5213abf46,easy if they spit fire change the weapon 
4910.0,5aea5a285545be5dc31353b84b5f93a5213abf46,borderlands 101 when a enemy uses a innate elemnent that doesn't come from a gun they are resistant or immune to it and hence go for oppsosite weapon elekment or no element 
4996.0,5aea5a285545be5dc31353b84b5f93a5213abf46,he is spitting corrosive so looks like duel resist so non elemental or cryo oe maybe electric will have to be considered 
5149.0,5aea5a285545be5dc31353b84b5f93a5213abf46,well you have to watch and see what they enemy does if they use something of element then you have to chane it and if mor ethan 1 element your best bet is to assume he is immune to that element too 
5159.0,725de843e67eb1820aa4ef05775b629d7a371ce6,so much for the whole saying fight fire with fire 
5226.0,5aea5a285545be5dc31353b84b5f93a5213abf46,well on rare cases there are enemies that have triple resists or even rarer there may be enemies that havee a rotation resist but you need to figure that out for yourself but that rex you fought i saw it use lightning to so you ran into a triple res boss monster 
5322.0,5aea5a285545be5dc31353b84b5f93a5213abf46,the rarer enemies are ones that have triple resist or rotating resist 
5380.0,5aea5a285545be5dc31353b84b5f93a5213abf46,that maybe the case but at least you won't get penalize on shooting a enemy that is resistant or immune to that element 
5412.0,5aea5a285545be5dc31353b84b5f93a5213abf46,you may lose out on dos but you won't lose dps if you go non elemental 
5449.0,5aea5a285545be5dc31353b84b5f93a5213abf46,besides running a non elemental is a last resrort if none of the elemnts work on the boss 
5578.0,5aea5a285545be5dc31353b84b5f93a5213abf46,semi automatic allows short burst fire while full automatic allosws you to hold down the button to shoot continuosly until the clip runs out
