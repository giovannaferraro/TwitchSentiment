16503.0,54e9b2e5858ba314a0cc9c46625ab7df524594e6,bots influence the top 1% of players shitty seasons and stale gameplay influence everyone 
16511.0,0ea08236477e27db79653be8d8d3f6b9d506bdc2,probably 75-80% of the playerbase uses macros

16866.0,0ea08236477e27db79653be8d8d3f6b9d506bdc2,it wasnt anything changed from regular thorns tbh 
16879.0,0ea08236477e27db79653be8d8d3f6b9d506bdc2,it was normal thorns being shown in a t16 rift 
16883.0,237ed1745d778a0e66ccdbbde675312553cbfba4,it starts with a r 
16884.0,0ea08236477e27db79653be8d8d3f6b9d506bdc2,saying it was a super powerful build

17082.0,54e9b2e5858ba314a0cc9c46625ab7df524594e6,starts with an r 
17085.0,237ed1745d778a0e66ccdbbde675312553cbfba4,its always bad and misleading or crucial things missing

17270.0,237ed1745d778a0e66ccdbbde675312553cbfba4,its not on purpose i understand but if you're going to make a guide on something that is suppose to help people learn things i'd like if the guides didn't have incorrect info 
17285.0,237ed1745d778a0e66ccdbbde675312553cbfba4,its like in someone in ffxiv made a guide on paladin and it was really incorrect 
17295.0,0ea08236477e27db79653be8d8d3f6b9d506bdc2,yeah don't make a guide a 20 min long guide video on something you don't know about
