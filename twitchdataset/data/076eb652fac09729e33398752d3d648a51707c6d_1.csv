1407.0,2047942a294877ade059074c4f0d4fe9592e0df5,i like mobile games but i agree with you 
1439.0,b67cf97456112524ad01724c9c26835732039a8c,i rarely play mobile games even with having the newest phones etc

2602.0,6a14e48f52dc9e6eba07c513f059027e85a3e734,in philosophy and rhetoric the principle of charity or charitable interpretation requires interpreting a speaker's statements in the most rational way possible and in the case of any argument considering its best strongest possible interpretation [1] in its narrowest sense the goal of this methodological principle is to avoid attributing irrationality logical fallacies or falsehoods to the others statements when a coherent rational interpretation of the statements is available

7743.0,f2f66aa05154dbbb288a584147d305e53618e57d,this is a way to subjective list too many fan bases for it to be cohesive
