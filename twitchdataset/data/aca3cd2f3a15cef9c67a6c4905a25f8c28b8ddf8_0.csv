9408.0,f5a549b7d369a05e82c61406dee6f57fd18f84cc,bontu i haven't seen or tried after release i think its too slow since midnight reaper for example creates enough card draw with sacs could still work 
9409.0,21c8fb0cf130535feece141eb72fadc380750583,aca3cd2f3a15cef9c67a6c4905a25f8c28b8ddf8 shouldn't you domri first there

9448.0,55cc250579a59a3f081f939952617299cdcd50a1,golos is def tier 1 so inevitable 
9456.0,2ba5f1cc0f7c2f52c3be55a0c37ea24c2463b7a7,okay so rankle is seeing some play just as a 3/3 haste flyer or what his trigger doesnt seem that good from the frist glance

9591.0,2ba5f1cc0f7c2f52c3be55a0c37ea24c2463b7a7,oh also i need some advice - it seems like rakdos can go either aggro or sacrifice but not both the question is - should i run cards like dreadhorde butcher and judith alongside mayhem devil cat oven etc or its better to split those to two different decks 
9608.0,2ba5f1cc0f7c2f52c3be55a0c37ea24c2463b7a7,questing beast is as good as everyone thought its going to be

9661.0,21c8fb0cf130535feece141eb72fadc380750583,v confused by that 
9665.0,55cc250579a59a3f081f939952617299cdcd50a1,from what i'm seeing the sacrifice shell works pretty well without judith or butcher the new star of the deck is ayara tho 
9669.0,fd24570f3af1f53b0798f7077141c2fd9064d45d,if he has another tolsimir in hand he keeps the wolf plsu gets another one 
9672.0,21c8fb0cf130535feece141eb72fadc380750583,aca3cd2f3a15cef9c67a6c4905a25f8c28b8ddf8 tolsimir has the triggers for other wolves 
9676.0,e3a12676d7a029ff2649519aca2fe4292f869679,both are legendary so tol dies 
9679.0,e2b2deadcaac1a2206fe402ddedf3d3698220659,enemy has no wolves anyways so doesnt relaly maatter 
9679.0,fc3e9dd7533cf84bcfae32806090bbae8a954e76,tolsimir seems like a nice dude friend to wolves and all that 
9681.0,898499adc806925cf69e14ed883029af0e304422,if he play other wolf tho 
9682.0,21c8fb0cf130535feece141eb72fadc380750583,and either way if he plays another tolsimir they have two 3/3

9697.0,e67762bea39af465068445707e2dcea700e00f75,if only i were a wolf i could be pals with tolsimir biblethump 
9697.0,d6f1bbe5c815791a9ef91ac817e223fbc62e7e7f,they'll gain 6 life and the wolf will fight twice i believe 
9699.0,e3a12676d7a029ff2649519aca2fe4292f869679,i think the token is the correct target if they play another they lose the tol if the wolf would die on a fight 
9706.0,f5a549b7d369a05e82c61406dee6f57fd18f84cc,i personally would not run butcher with with devils with the early meta it seems that people are splitting with aggro and sacs aggro is far more popular 
9723.0,21c8fb0cf130535feece141eb72fadc380750583,e3a12676d7a029ff2649519aca2fe4292f869679 in either case you're left with one tolsimir in that case 
9728.0,d6f1bbe5c815791a9ef91ac817e223fbc62e7e7f,wait nevermind 
9732.0,d6f1bbe5c815791a9ef91ac817e223fbc62e7e7f,i'm wrong

9754.0,6a2b0de20fcbd801ebdd6a94c1f48e48d70a7296,the wolf looks more like that bear from the book series 
9757.0,fc3e9dd7533cf84bcfae32806090bbae8a954e76,is voja a friend to all elves or just tolsimir

9766.0,b45dfeda3b0c991690d40db3be955348daf28cd8,i think hes referring to the op's golden lands from lantern 
9772.0,fd24570f3af1f53b0798f7077141c2fd9064d45d,effect of the lantern - means it can produce any color mana
