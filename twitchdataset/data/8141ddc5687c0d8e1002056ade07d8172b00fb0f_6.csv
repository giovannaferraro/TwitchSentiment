25.0,661a378f06cbedfb00040be9e57cca2d863f2dbd,ouch 
33.0,12f90acd2573cc7d8b1a793853d7a2c224f503e4,what would you think about multani in the sideboard instead of pelakka wurm it's a big legendary threat that tramples it does a similar job to pelakka wurm but is also picked up by vow it gets stronger with vow being able to pick up lands as well it also stays big if the lands from nissa's uptick are destroyed the only way i can see wurm being better is that it gains 7 life basically my argument is that it provides more synergy than pelakka wurm 8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f 
39.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,wow only 10 basics no wonder kappa

70.0,77c37265a2d60d65944fcb31419bcc7ce948a005,also pelakka wurm blocks everything but ghalta on the ground :d 
73.0,5788fa43896bdefe08bc13d5610b615927f21d2c,wakka wurm can';t be cast off vow though right 
105.0,12f90acd2573cc7d8b1a793853d7a2c224f503e4,my thinking there was that the legendary merfolk was for the aggro matchups and that the wurm was for going big over other big creature decks 
112.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,they had triple duress and double trophy it happenss

127.0,cf8bf19264a5b1940b037d331c3fde7738d734b9,question if you cast a legendary sorcery and while its on the stack they destroy your only legend does it resolve or fizzle

4892.0,9a4f7df44330a16bbbb7f0190b79b7a6d54c061e,in my experience mayhem devil is a card that can be good but relies heavily on you being in a good position when you cast it 
4896.0,8a877dfa60d7ea9701d4f4d221fd1ce49c0ca4c5,as you can see hear i missed my 3rd land drop ouch

4901.0,6f7ef951fefddc554ed7cea81772a8b4a0b17beb,pick specific games that you like 
4905.0,931367fee08586f3324cebe8e2e555dd4fd07059,should this deck max out the 1 drops it has a bunch of card draw and they seem key to multiple spell plays and getting fast judy/priest value 
4915.0,c4bd3dab4c61f47474bf242e47eaef9320d870b7,perhaps a well curated replay then

5064.0,fcc86b8455e1eacf5e1fb5d91a8b1e1e073a3395,well if the enforcer tapped your thing then you have a bunch of 2/2s against a 1/2 and you can just attack with the priests 
5086.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,why not attack with butcher last turn kill both tokens or get him 1 bigger

5199.0,931367fee08586f3324cebe8e2e555dd4fd07059,you should mark the specific 4 extra lands you drew and swap those into 3 and 4 mana spells so that flood doesn't happen again 4head 
5207.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,so by that logic we should have put more lands in

6839.0,4adea6d8afa8d9df21f6d3821189aa0b7d379f3d,the only takeaway with fail games like this is are there decks less prone to fail e g decks with opt or mono red that can sometimes work on 2 lands for quite some time

10692.0,499e464d997dfc8359a8d6d064453c3c3262d134,yeah i agree that's one of gr's biggest problems it jsut doesn't see as many cards as many other decks so you get some wrong half problems somewhat like control decks 
10709.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,maybe wait on twister and try and win idk
