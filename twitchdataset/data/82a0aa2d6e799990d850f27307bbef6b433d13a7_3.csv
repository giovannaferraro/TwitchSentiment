9792.0,1a07346a021909f96ca7b0a828d1ebe4e7a466e5,i could imagine they dont want to run the risk of false positives 
9804.0,14557b8db71e2614db00b8735966a79a48fa779e,they only ban pretty much those who either 24/7 or just go for leaderboards after botting they don't care about your average joe botting to skip the grind and just have endgame full 
9808.0,14557b8db71e2614db00b8735966a79a48fa779e,endgame fun*

9883.0,7c0622a772c77c2169f1b5127c201bbe0ca597db,yeah i was referring to season 5 with the whole ban thing pretty sure that's when gaby got banned 
9936.0,14557b8db71e2614db00b8735966a79a48fa779e,6fdc21e4c76816f404e61afc6186a87abe2be968 if the entry to leaderboards is 130 for say 4 man and you just wanna run 110 or 120 with your friends with finished builds that can be fun for them different people different fun factors

10163.0,1265f3072f456d84302d35a95df2db811825e53e,so any person that mainly plays solo should feel mandated to play wizard because otherwise they are progressing at a huuuuuge suboptimal rate 
10198.0,c2ecf37616a78673ef1105392d8882f9c50a4c82,i'm ready for the support meta to be changed up a bit tbh :p i miss wd and crusader back in the day ;0

10258.0,a9c5ec4ac84ce0af162ff2eec3ece2820a8ad123,funny thing they nerfed captain america that will get forgotten when lon season is over 
10259.0,91f18c8327ca2b54ab99ed9fe4bb632972af1f3c,they don't do many in-season nerfs 
10275.0,d7a616050b69c575fa594013d12cc2884bf17360,for some people it's not only about the most optimal or efficient way to play but rather what is more fun to them 
10284.0,6a5d56e879fc21d773bd1d629427d83b1b8edb2e,u have caldesan on ur gear 
10293.0,0446930a3a25b2a68922f418804320d82bd3aead,to be completely honest the builds doesnt need to be nerfed you need to buff some of the lower preforming classes but right now it feels like the only people that the gr levels matters to is the ones in top 10 on the leaderboards 
10299.0,d7a616050b69c575fa594013d12cc2884bf17360,if it was only about optimal efficiency everybody would have to run 4 man rats 24/7
