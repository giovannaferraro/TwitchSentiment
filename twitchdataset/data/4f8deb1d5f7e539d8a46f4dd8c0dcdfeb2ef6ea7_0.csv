53.0,ebaec1bfdff30844940e4db423d93adb3f5ad0a7,what about limiting the distance range of nydus 
55.0,7161f878e083a0f1379019d054c4d6f072b6e5d0,maybe to compensate you allow overloards to drop creep just a little faster

136.0,ce8fbf992fdd225cf0abc0340dc1b923bc29e54e,if you could give an example of a good sized map from the past what would it be 
153.0,bef78a34ef5bc2c3735e0191fb7923062671bcfb,the length of maps is irritating travel time too long this season

330.0,ebaec1bfdff30844940e4db423d93adb3f5ad0a7,i'm decided not to veto any of the maps because they are all so bad that i dread the next map release - so may as well play them all 
334.0,bef78a34ef5bc2c3735e0191fb7923062671bcfb,i mean this map at least we can take a watch tower

709.0,9eaec58340489772f2c103937989842bf7df2003,yeah it sucks if you play eco greed to try to keep up with zerg's economic potential you die to nydus 
719.0,4e0911aea797d05cd5d4dc5f40d8c483006ee140,nydus needs to be 75/75 and a few sec longer build time it would still be super viable 
763.0,ee17e50aa1a75b57c2d2e1790d97fd2c5e235a77,ridiculous so hard to push terran straight forward even in siege mode 
819.0,227e0ea35fafb5bfec4e306991321510bb596a9a,ling bane is super supply effective 
823.0,76b6b2102f86f403d22cfaf2681fce19cae8140c,i miss bald guy already :( 
829.0,ce8fbf992fdd225cf0abc0340dc1b923bc29e54e,yeah gone are the days where to get a 6th base meant taking a base close to your opponent 
843.0,ee17e50aa1a75b57c2d2e1790d97fd2c5e235a77,all toss and zerg needs to do is just def and macro def everybase of drop and macro and terran so dead :) 
853.0,ce8fbf992fdd225cf0abc0340dc1b923bc29e54e,i totally agree 
869.0,07784c44f9a5e7f72c803376ed3f33b13c4bda6c,maru actullay got shit on today tbh 
879.0,dc6f02a36658c31a04b4b6e551e2c77718980143,i can't believe stats had to cannon rush to beat rogue zerg is so strong right now 
879.0,2ee565b2e09655e716b7e07741704635e2221c7a,im glad for the new maps because it has excentuated a problem that already existed 
880.0,4e0911aea797d05cd5d4dc5f40d8c483006ee140,heromarine thinks balance isn't terrible if the maps are fixed maybe z still a bit strong but mainly maps 
892.0,bc00942067c4b4b8f5cef1fb65f973bca759f13a,maybe the zerg will just start fighting themself cause fighting terrans is no longer a challenge kappa 
902.0,76b6b2102f86f403d22cfaf2681fce19cae8140c,maru looked so good in game 1 i wasnt here to watch the replay with you guys but live his mulittasking was hard to follow as a spectator 
905.0,22a5a87596c08b9740e499b9e5cbcc7b2112e3d3,when is next season new maps? 
912.0,8a9f5de5e2dd5a4def6ea8ede201b631192783f3,heromarine also thinks nydus has to change 
919.0,3c9226e44e172fce673bb31e6ca66876157367ac,main thing i'm upset is that maru of all players deserves a blizzcon trophey and he's being denied one :( 
921.0,10a177465b53271732485f1a3575bcdca97673f1,dc6f02a36658c31a04b4b6e551e2c77718980143 i think you should beleive that after so many years canon rush is strong enough to kill a pro-player liek rogue 
922.0,ce8fbf992fdd225cf0abc0340dc1b923bc29e54e,i mean it makes a lot of early game pressure a lot softer don't get me wrong i don't want hots level roach ravager pushes again but try doing that on these maps it tends to not go well 
935.0,10a177465b53271732485f1a3575bcdca97673f1,but then its truth 
938.0,76b6b2102f86f403d22cfaf2681fce19cae8140c,that's a really good point 
942.0,585b860b3ae34ecb3a9f9f0970c002335d3eabf5,but dark made a huge mistake in game 1 in my opinion 
950.0,227e0ea35fafb5bfec4e306991321510bb596a9a,huge maps are really bad for terran 
954.0,4ff6b753edea0ab4324c1b965de5d47d4322ab2e,can u even proxy on this map 
956.0,dc6f02a36658c31a04b4b6e551e2c77718980143,10a177465b53271732485f1a3575bcdca97673f1 the point is that stats is the most defensive protoss out there and even he thought he had to cheese to have a chance 
962.0,76b6b2102f86f403d22cfaf2681fce19cae8140c,what mistake nothing sticks out that i remember 
967.0,d045f0d06f20ed40b7090751f9bf04e03167ea53,feels like there is some good maps this map pool but there should be mixed in 2-3 smaller maps aswell 
969.0,bef78a34ef5bc2c3735e0191fb7923062671bcfb,wait is thunderbird smaller than world of sleepers changing vetoes asap 
976.0,22be8bd506fb57958d6dee14d09b54bfa3f1345f,rouge spoke the truth and top it off with maps like this where else does terran go 
991.0,585b860b3ae34ecb3a9f9f0970c002335d3eabf5,he attacks maru with like 6 bases mining and creep on whole map he should just sit back 
994.0,ebaec1bfdff30844940e4db423d93adb3f5ad0a7,no creep past half the map and maru can't hold a 4th base 
1001.0,d045f0d06f20ed40b7090751f9bf04e03167ea53,4f8deb1d5f7e539d8a46f4dd8c0dcdfeb2ef6ea7 was that you on screen there 
1002.0,10a177465b53271732485f1a3575bcdca97673f1,dc6f02a36658c31a04b4b6e551e2c77718980143 i think the point should also be that canon rushing should even exist instead it can beat a zerg liek rogue 
1007.0,ab2f768991a00e2d595270a397279697fb75cba7,so in which phase is terran favored on this big map pools and how would it look like if its smaller it feels like there is almost no phase 
1028.0,10a177465b53271732485f1a3575bcdca97673f1,slouldnt* 
1042.0,ebaec1bfdff30844940e4db423d93adb3f5ad0a7,1st 60 seconds works for terran lol
