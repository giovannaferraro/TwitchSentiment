4986.0,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8,should have sacked history instead of land there 
4995.0,4a80986e36ad6423c6b16bf79efa0a5f17266c8d,they taste the same 
4997.0,2604358bdcfd6f07a475d39b12afab5a992b4afd,oh god i hope they thought erasure again 
5001.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,so at this point you would be able to blow up bolas with a blast zone if the arch had been one 
5016.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,blast zone now seems better 
5024.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,it seems like arch is inferior here 
5039.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,the problem with bz over arch is arch is this deck's main draw engine 
5042.0,580ecaa2204ccaa50a73e2ef4fee1cd18df093e4,home made fizzy drinks are the best - one thing of soda water juice a lime into it and we grow a ton of mint so throw some in the best 
5053.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,and the deck feels really card hungry

5078.0,87fcf020fe9e6221958c5f2c736c54ba1fb31c71,how is this deck gaining any sort of card advantage without arch treasure map 
5080.0,1a28c2ae49f5c5c858a537a9741f7d91d0d3a9ab,i think arch is generally better 
5083.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,he has arches more consistently than maps 
5086.0,5fa839bba354203858ef30f7259349684bec40f3,580ecaa2204ccaa50a73e2ef4fee1cd18df093e4 that sounds real@close to a mojito and we're in business 
5086.0,519a2d73403dfd1be6d2b4f6020509c01b408f32,why does the order matter 
5091.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,but blast zone is a answer 
5110.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,not trying to harp on it but in that situation i really cant see how arch was better than bz 
5111.0,7cfe2d8bf0c2a85e7b2ac80c61470e09e3ede972,ugin 
5114.0,580ecaa2204ccaa50a73e2ef4fee1cd18df093e4,28ac731921fc03eab695e87db830b445b703785a it's like poor man's mojito lul keeps it work friendly though they may frown on that in the break room 
5116.0,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8,blast zone is worse but we need more answers doesnt quite track 
5123.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,in all situations i'm not sure 
5125.0,969fe4ccdfeab983ded3293b4a7200f46b0ece2f,you are harping on it a little bit to be fair 
5128.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,7cfe2d8bf0c2a85e7b2ac80c61470e09e3ede972 he doesn't want planeswalkers 
5129.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,but in that situation certainly 
5132.0,b64d4a251635ab16bae13b3aca73d95ce88d44f6,holding onto the zacama that long was unfortunate 
5137.0,7cfe2d8bf0c2a85e7b2ac80c61470e09e3ede972,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da i keep forgetting lul 
5142.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,i know 
5150.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,i've made the same mistake like 3 times with suggestions 
5154.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,how many cards did you discard to bolas 
5171.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,in a planeswalker meta it seems like no-planeswalker controlish type decks seem strictly worse =/ 
5176.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,that reasoning makes zero sense 
5179.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,bz deleted mono u from meta dayjoy 
5181.0,d2969456b5299a75e170ed75df7935697ca562dd,blast zone is very situational and can hinder sean's side of the board as well can be pretty weak 
5187.0,519a2d73403dfd1be6d2b4f6020509c01b408f32,you seem to have a lot of lands unused at times maybe that land that creates 1/1s 
5190.0,f68a280e85fbf3a501cab9699cd1eeb912e02316,arch finds answers the deck needs more answers to draw 
5197.0,d2969456b5299a75e170ed75df7935697ca562dd,bz is best against aggro running a lot of 1-2 cmc 
5205.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,like i agree aggro is the best reason to run bz 
5207.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,land that creates 1/1s the first fort 
5217.0,4ad72c10c5a95a585df2dceeb3633ac48ceea6b0,blastzone also has to be set up over several turns at which point a threa like dragon god etc have gotten their value 
5222.0,069f0350820390cfcbe2718ab7cd34973c9ad924,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 what does draw first do 
5225.0,6cb19c99bbfd889291ea25b8ef262da896dcdbdb,the reward progression in the new momir event is pretty cool 
5226.0,88c4d08cb705a3a7ade0787d67c0409677f9cec0,finale of glory to compliment all the land 
5226.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,but to claim that the fact that any deck can run bz makes it mediocre has no discernable logic 
5227.0,5fa839bba354203858ef30f7259349684bec40f3,we never have three creature that attack to flip landing 
5243.0,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8,to be clear i wouldnt run blast zone in this either but i dont think that game was a good demonstration of running arch over it 
5260.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8 exactly what i'm getting at 
5266.0,4e741d75619e1e1ccf1adb13d00dc2bb784930a6,day9 
5277.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,i think 2 archs 1 bz is the right choice 
5278.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,naya just doesn't have very good answers to walkers outside of big creatures 
5305.0,e1e731d8e6044385e1bf3c896704030764e60c94,i missed the overview of your sideboard and it might be way too slow but is star of extinction in the sb 
5313.0,b64d4a251635ab16bae13b3aca73d95ce88d44f6,i think that last match zacama should've been played before trostani 
5331.0,f22aed278a381dbd231a5367cf5268e4476d0132,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 what about gruul spellbreaker instead of history riot to get over clarion haste for the control match up 
5342.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,if you're willing to swap red for black you could have access to some p good murder spells 
5353.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,why does this deck even have red anyway 
5354.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,what 
5362.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,but you had to deal with bolas in that game 
5371.0,843671fd9b5b69a71b11231e64159c3324d6cf2c,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac for zacama mama 
5371.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,you had yet to deal with bolas when you conceded 
5372.0,c8fab5bbde8d5d752d44cd90128a6e99e69404d0,domri's ambush or thrash are answers to planewalkers but they require creatures 
5372.0,3f9971941e0e974bcb05124a1e94e3659ca0ea7a,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac zacama 
5375.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 ixalan's binding seems like a potential better sideboard card against decks like grixis which quickly put out multiple copies of the same planeswalker don't you think 
5397.0,d2969456b5299a75e170ed75df7935697ca562dd,how do you feel about the new vraska in sideboard against pw in place of maybe 2 nullhide 
5403.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,my apologies 
5406.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,not my intention 
5417.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,if you really want zacama i guess you could run urban utopia but she kinda isn't doing much atm 
5430.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,agreed arch is certainly better hear 
5430.0,87fcf020fe9e6221958c5f2c736c54ba1fb31c71,prison realm is less good because vraska is making a comeback due to 3feri 
5435.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,she gets deleted by walkers biblethump 
5436.0,843671fd9b5b69a71b11231e64159c3324d6cf2c,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766 don't worry dude you will forever be better than that dude who subbed just to argue with sean about a math question 
5445.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,843671fd9b5b69a71b11231e64159c3324d6cf2c what math question 
5455.0,843671fd9b5b69a71b11231e64159c3324d6cf2c,for one because he was actually rude and for seconds because we paused stream for math ;p 
5462.0,9ac51179e542c4fd63b1c204ef27d977bd0a3a28,was that the probability debacle 
5464.0,843671fd9b5b69a71b11231e64159c3324d6cf2c,monty hall problem duder didnt understand it 
5468.0,843671fd9b5b69a71b11231e64159c3324d6cf2c,haha yeah exactly 
5470.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,lol 
5475.0,e1e731d8e6044385e1bf3c896704030764e60c94,oh righto you can check the sideboard in this nifty addon 
5486.0,d33ac6914da326e0b6993e9066a568d56f233bc9,i think most grixis only play 2-3 of for permanents so ixilans may not be great the 4-of for them are usually spells 
5488.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,binding is better tbh 
5488.0,3bc356874b59b42dea72e54db11cc350d96face3,oh man arguing about the monty hall problem is my least favorite thing 
5491.0,9ac51179e542c4fd63b1c204ef27d977bd0a3a28,it was about probability the gender of children 
5495.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,the only thing better would have been a 999 = 1 debate 
5502.0,5fa839bba354203858ef30f7259349684bec40f3,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 i think beepbeep said earlier and you might have missed but he compromised into 2 arches and 1 bz same mana base and mostly engine but blast zone is one more answer 
5507.0,843671fd9b5b69a71b11231e64159c3324d6cf2c,9ac51179e542c4fd63b1c204ef27d977bd0a3a28 well that was the context but iirc it came down to monty hall 
5509.0,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 have you been watching the mh spoilers 
5510.0,4efc2ea62b9a144ae9a72bc5e1c13e27c4650c95,i kinda wanna see this debate now 
5522.0,28ac731921fc03eab695e87db830b445b703785a,that was bae's theorem wasn't it when we used ms paint 
5527.0,9ac51179e542c4fd63b1c204ef27d977bd0a3a28,843671fd9b5b69a71b11231e64159c3324d6cf2c well fair its about the probably based on known/unknown information 
5531.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,i fucking love the monty hall problem just because it fucking breaks peoples brain 
5535.0,5b159fff1378a25998dde76aa7ec11af0531588d,069f0350820390cfcbe2718ab7cd34973c9ad924 when the game starts instead of the game just selecting who gets to play turn 1 first it selects a person get to choose if they want to play turn 1 first i believe there are some decks that may want to play second but not a very common play to my understanding 
5541.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,aggro pog 
5542.0,4bb2ffe71ec3f08dcb22a7f6914c3a06dc5526fd,try and cast scry effects after you cast search effects

5555.0,843671fd9b5b69a71b11231e64159c3324d6cf2c,yeah wizard im garbage at math and all things related to it so you grasp it much better than me 
5557.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,my bad i missed that

5593.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,keep pog

5653.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 i agree i think that example ignores the fact that you have to telegraph the blast zone before the bolas is on the field the opp may not have played bolas if we had bz on the field until he could overwhelm us

5798.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,there aren't really any decks playing things like disinformation campaign now-a-days so nullhide isn't that good

5840.0,5fa839bba354203858ef30f7259349684bec40f3,then we need to change mana base 
5841.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,double reds and double whites 
5859.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 how about chandra 
5865.0,88c4d08cb705a3a7ade0787d67c0409677f9cec0,you could take lava coils in sb now 
5866.0,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8,f9c4a8ca04b6e1a71a5bc2333a53aa8a27bcb890 yeah but the problem is then we cant play half our cards and we likely dont win off having a 6/6 on board 
5873.0,e9ed51ad92e9fadf19005bf6b5cc12c2b5261242,finale of glory could make a good replacement for benalia and a good flexible use of mana 
5886.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,f9c4a8ca04b6e1a71a5bc2333a53aa8a27bcb890 the problem though is that the only discard people really run is thought erasure which they can just not choose the nullhide with so you aren't ever going to play against like disinformation campaign where you get him in for free 
5887.0,5ac5d839539f103dd7450ca73d1259739f15479c,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 you can now change your basic land art directly in the client 
5890.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,you might not have enough mana to cast nova on 5 
5895.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,i like the idea of more finale of glory 
5910.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 sorry to reiterate but did you consider the new chandra 
5920.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,no walkers 
5920.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766 immortal sun so no walkers 
5925.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,oh right 
5928.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,lol 
5930.0,f22aed278a381dbd231a5367cf5268e4476d0132,spellbreaker :grinning_face_with_sweat: 
5935.0,6cb19c99bbfd889291ea25b8ef262da896dcdbdb,more immortal suns for the side 
5947.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,definitely feels weird saying no walkers in the current meta lul 
5953.0,6989da723d4d50dbfd94025c6303977228fed51e,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 correct me if i'm wrong but didnt your previous version of this list have jadelight and wildgrowth walkers in it for some early game threats that also let you build up mana a bit faster 
5953.0,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766 also chandra is threatening because hitting her deals damage but if we're not playing a high-pressure game that damage isnt scary 
5956.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,deffinitely need at least 1 more immortal sun in side board 
5968.0,39dc4929efe63bd1de0b35cf390024f1a2a5e768,drop a forest for temple garden 
5970.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8 i was more referring to the card advantage issue 
5973.0,f9c4a8ca04b6e1a71a5bc2333a53aa8a27bcb890,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f they also run nicol bolas the ravager which lets us choose 
5981.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,that's even more dangerous now that you have so many red cards 
5992.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,but yeah not being able to run walkers and having problems with card advantage is pretty yikes 
5994.0,5fa839bba354203858ef30f7259349684bec40f3,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 what about just running gates route still fetched 
5996.0,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766 right but the card advantage only comes if she isnt removed and if we're not pressuring the opponent's life total she's much easier to remove 
6002.0,f9c4a8ca04b6e1a71a5bc2333a53aa8a27bcb890,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8 thats a better reason not to have it in alright 
6002.0,018cb5f9e5c3bc6d073627ee8fab1eeeafda8834,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 lol you love pelakka wurm huh 
6002.0,39dc4929efe63bd1de0b35cf390024f1a2a5e768,also why not prioritize shock over check lands 
6005.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,certainly 
6012.0,5fa839bba354203858ef30f7259349684bec40f3,and we aren't super super concerned about curving out 
6015.0,5ac5d839539f103dd7450ca73d1259739f15479c,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 you can now change your basic land art directly in the client 
6019.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,actually ugin would probably be a more worthwhile walker to run if you were to run any 
6022.0,39dc4929efe63bd1de0b35cf390024f1a2a5e768,you have a fair bit of heal 
6045.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,i would just run shocks over checks

6065.0,d2969456b5299a75e170ed75df7935697ca562dd,gates can feel really slow in a starting hand 
6069.0,5fa839bba354203858ef30f7259349684bec40f3,drop forest for grull gate 
6077.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,not being able to phoenix/nova on curve would be backbreaking

7185.0,018cb5f9e5c3bc6d073627ee8fab1eeeafda8834,they revealed a 2 drop sliver that gives all slivers you control flying and haste the world is over 
7192.0,580ecaa2204ccaa50a73e2ef4fee1cd18df093e4,commander on arena seems like it would be missing the most crucial aspect of the format which is the social interaction

7238.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,the whole point of this deck is for day9 to laugh while playing pelakka wurms 
7240.0,e1e731d8e6044385e1bf3c896704030764e60c94,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 how do you feel about some sweet lyra in this deck i think you could possibly benefit from some angelic lifelinkers 
7253.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,actually that's a lie when i got to use urza's ruinous blast to kill my mono-red opponent's creatures and frenzy at the same time and he conceded before the animation even finished that was the best 
7262.0,1a28c2ae49f5c5c858a537a9741f7d91d0d3a9ab,lyra instead of bronto

7311.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,this deck was supposed to be anti walkers but is really just an elaborate excuse to play pellaka wurms and zacama 
7312.0,e1e731d8e6044385e1bf3c896704030764e60c94,you could also go a little less top heavy against aggro and side in lyra so dino out lyra in or something

7445.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,god how many more months until dominaria rotates 
7446.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 are the brontos really the best choice 
7450.0,d33ac6914da326e0b6993e9066a568d56f233bc9,i would think treasure maps too slow against aggro 
7455.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,circuitous routes seem medium vs aggro 
7458.0,65b531dfa720a9221fb2da163425a37d7ad6373a,do you run march against aggro 
7461.0,e1e731d8e6044385e1bf3c896704030764e60c94,might need to cut routes

7475.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac sadly the rotation of dominaria will not stop you from having to play against time raveler every game teferi is here to stay lul 
7475.0,94db773a9b1fb563c2787ee12049db3ce5618b53,oh man i love tolsimir

7518.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,that being said i love the design on time raveler in comparison to hero of dominaria they're just so different cards but still both extremely powerful 
7521.0,d33ac6914da326e0b6993e9066a568d56f233bc9,autumn can kill both frenzy or gain 4 life both quite good against mono-red 
7524.0,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8,65b531dfa720a9221fb2da163425a37d7ad6373a its a bad card 
7534.0,1e580584ae6899a2bc57de8fc0dc81de30337940,still mana curve issues 
7549.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,time raveler is probably gonna be playable in modern 
7560.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 sorry your what is feeling stiff now 
7563.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i think time raveler is already playable in every format 
7584.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,the first legacy video mengucci put out was him playing narset and time raveler in legacy miracles and it seems like 4c leovold is just dead in comparison 
7584.0,d33ac6914da326e0b6993e9066a568d56f233bc9,i don't think i saw new teferi in modern i did see new karn tho

7604.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,yeah tef needs to get the jtms treatment 
7616.0,1e580584ae6899a2bc57de8fc0dc81de30337940,f151c7cff276520070b73df49c8e276182ba7ca9 he gets it from his fasha 
7622.0,bf56faebf5588c55999c53a6fdf1d243e81867ad,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 ugh i am right there with you my neck has been really tight on the right side all day like i slept on it wrong and now it has a pain-string tied in there 
7631.0,7288ed99adb971736311657b724ece3be6772c75,simic yoink deck 
7631.0,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8,tamiyo is the new harbinger of cancer 
7633.0,7288ed99adb971736311657b724ece3be6772c75,you hard counter this 
7633.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,he's incredibly format warping but i guess you could say the same about ashiok 
7637.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,simic ramp time 
7638.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,my prediction for how modern horizons warps the meta is that straight bant midrange playing vivien champion of the wilds and time raveler is going to be tier 1 
7646.0,ebdb65f0cf6f2933c7888a3cf167d6fe1b4ae3be,my neck hurts and i have a general feeling of malaise 
7647.0,bf56faebf5588c55999c53a6fdf1d243e81867ad,it's so distracting to deal with persistent neck pain 
7662.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,think about it you play against tron and you go turn 1 giver of runes into turn 2 gaddock teeg they're probably just going to scoop them up after that 
7682.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,teferi was a mistake and you can't change my mind 
7696.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,giver of runes into gaddock teeg / meddling mage is going to be the new curve in modern and it's going to be followed with either vivien or time raveler 
7724.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,what's going to be interesting to see is how vivien and time raveler push aether vial and thalia out of the deck 
7742.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,i don't think you push aether vial 
7749.0,979e15c2af7281e09eba1b12eb1276038e65766e,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 sean i just wanted to say recently your content has gotten me through some extreamly tough times i wanted to thank you for everything you do you mean more than you will ever know to some of us 
7759.0,1e580584ae6899a2bc57de8fc0dc81de30337940,oh yeah he is def gonna clense 
7769.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i think it's iffy but you can't vial in the planeswalkers and it's not a hit with vivien so i think it might not be worth playing the vial 
7786.0,e5ff5736fe562f59386e4b81e932205620a8e2c4,dayheart 979e15c2af7281e09eba1b12eb1276038e65766e <3 i'm glad things here helped you out nopefully things are getting better thanks for the positiivity

7795.0,e1e731d8e6044385e1bf3c896704030764e60c94,could have been sweet to burn two treasure for the lava coil on the god 
7801.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,also if you think about vivien is kind of a weaker aether vial in a way in that you can flash out your creatures still obviously you don't get them for free which is what makes vial really good 
7801.0,1e580584ae6899a2bc57de8fc0dc81de30337940,daysick daysick

7850.0,bf56faebf5588c55999c53a6fdf1d243e81867ad,that is bizarre 
7854.0,bf56faebf5588c55999c53a6fdf1d243e81867ad,why a 1/1 
7856.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,but vivien gives you some flexibility 
7866.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,idk i could see it maaaaaybe 
7867.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,yeah 
7872.0,bbecee5da234a794426fed9210642770f4893d67,trostani also gives back everyone their creatures if they steal it 
7874.0,bf56faebf5588c55999c53a6fdf1d243e81867ad,yeah i guess it must have been 
7875.0,b2dfd0422d69b02071c5e5f53761d7ef7a21ce5a,trostani gives you back your stuff if they're on the board 
7876.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,i think though playing bant midrange around key 2 drops like meddling mage and gaddock teeg is what will make up for not being able to double spell with vial 
7877.0,1e580584ae6899a2bc57de8fc0dc81de30337940,all the mana 
7882.0,1e580584ae6899a2bc57de8fc0dc81de30337940,inc krasis

8184.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,depends on how much mana you have 
8186.0,b1d69978bc48ded41e4047bfddf75803788ef9c8,his sideboard plan against a creature deck is like entrancing melody/mass manipulation so we just need to draw the anti-yoink 
8189.0,94db773a9b1fb563c2787ee12049db3ce5618b53,i guess baby teferi is why 
8192.0,d50114d4c710c38e93f3316bb10845f707bc539f,if you have 3 mana you can maybe still get a 2 drop with the bolt 
8214.0,978e8e844b2592241d13c0e2dd80210c67b072ac,baby tef is so so so good 
8217.0,bbecee5da234a794426fed9210642770f4893d67,it's very unlikely a deck that plays bolts doesn't also have a low curve

12922.0,7066594e84abc1aec2319516ca99862463fa1527,with war in standard i feel like you have to swap some of the more generic removal for planewalker specific stuff 
12927.0,1e580584ae6899a2bc57de8fc0dc81de30337940,it says oposing player or plainswalker so if you run that angle card that makes you hexproof she has to deal damage to herself 
12938.0,7066594e84abc1aec2319516ca99862463fa1527,cuz the baase power level of the set is just ridiculous

14639.0,053756b8f8943640591e4da42012a74887517f85,tyrus568 i think destiny's d gg chat is the best chat on the internet its a lot of freedom plus high educated and there is always interesting conversation even if destiny isnt live its a living creature all its own 
14641.0,436969de035f94bc72db507f703237ad14f3d3f4,search goes past small bolas a lot 
14641.0,898258915eccaa1c0aefd10b49c344a9e03e25c5,also day9 has his discord free if you wanna talk to the community of dayknights 
14646.0,55513f5b1b85f3f765752c12093c6b3f1c4b52e2,i've been in chats where even sub only was completely awful 1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 
14650.0,438b5bc5acde917a83c4916a4150cc280d3215be,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 with so many major planeswalkers being so strong like nicky b nissa and lillith why only have one immortal sun instead of 2 or possibly even three so that you can get it more consistently 
14656.0,fb09359dae69255f6ee14983f95c30b7662561ac,day[9] have you thought of making a magic tournament 
14668.0,053756b8f8943640591e4da42012a74887517f85,^^ 
14669.0,7aa837caef96298c4a40c391b2d0ff5a0f3f6865,it's always weird seeing people in different streams from other awesome communities cohhl 
14670.0,2516ec943058a4ab54f2231ee9624777ed7533eb,55513f5b1b85f3f765752c12093c6b3f1c4b52e2 the sub gifting system is great but contributes to that issue 
14677.0,898258915eccaa1c0aefd10b49c344a9e03e25c5,so for anyone in here who isnt a sub but wants to talk get in discord 
14681.0,1e580584ae6899a2bc57de8fc0dc81de30337940,okay chat im back what i miss 
14683.0,e5ff5736fe562f59386e4b81e932205620a8e2c4,indeed discord really enabled us to be able to offer both it's freen and open to all 
14685.0,e5ff5736fe562f59386e4b81e932205620a8e2c4,discord 
14686.0,4559353672efbcbd0bad25fcd509cadf0586a185,join the dayknight discord with over 20k members and 50 gaming and irl topics: https://discord gg/day9tv 
14695.0,d669856d9a4c6e8b231d6fc85d605e4a314f6acf,in theory a long follow-time requirement could work similarly to the sub requirement but changing to that would still add a lot more viewers and a lot more people who won't act appropriately in chat 
14701.0,1e580584ae6899a2bc57de8fc0dc81de30337940,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 if you use karin and then go get imortal sun from side board its easy to play 
14705.0,e5ff5736fe562f59386e4b81e932205620a8e2c4,we're actually the top 50 largest discords now daybroken 
14718.0,ebdb65f0cf6f2933c7888a3cf167d6fe1b4ae3be,you have to have two screens to make using discord and watching the stream at the same time a reality imo 
14721.0,46672e108d934ac8fef3693eb29baff91886ec30,immortal sun needs to disable the passive too

14734.0,5f3bad31ffd7b36588692983c7f58a082f1e9aa4,the passive is the best part of a lot of the most common small walkers 
14740.0,f1143272b702e1c7cfa1aaae76562eb80cdf7f45,i thought i was so clever for crafting four immortal suns before expansion

14755.0,e5ff5736fe562f59386e4b81e932205620a8e2c4,how are you doing 
14775.0,15f15191ad77f7a89eab97624ab9982d462bf6ce,also 6 mana for an answer is so clunky the best method to deal with planeswalkers is to not let them resolve in the first place or to have the board 
14799.0,d3f2f6a8bf7a78a996c74ad87bde898a79c7bdd7,053756b8f8943640591e4da42012a74887517f85 cool that sounds really interesting and positive i have been disappointed in my share of toxic chats on twitch and the net and in general and it can be hard to find bastions of supportive integrative sanity in the maelstrom of the internet >_> 
14801.0,183ba120dfa17fe9e12c1f5c42b7ee005422d4ed,not too bad thanks e5ff5736fe562f59386e4b81e932205620a8e2c4 
14819.0,053756b8f8943640591e4da42012a74887517f85,ferryman151 but it gives long term value by letting you draw and give +1+1 and spells cost 1 less to play 
14822.0,080b763943c25bb36dcab5225395d9ff95e6cef5,is it really immortal if it dies a lot 
14825.0,82e677c5f21db3e5dea13343ea505cbc6585043a,for a six mana artifact i think god pharaoh statue is better value hard to fit into decks though 
14911.0,438b5bc5acde917a83c4916a4150cc280d3215be,just run the immortal sun/karn/helm package where you draw 7 cards each time and your 1/1 acts like a gigantosaur lol 
14919.0,7aa837caef96298c4a40c391b2d0ff5a0f3f6865,this is like an entirely different matchup than game one lol

15286.0,82e677c5f21db3e5dea13343ea505cbc6585043a,the sun is sideboard at best i think 
15309.0,20f84f86d60e426d071054137bdf7d30cb94ede9,yeah it's really rough against grixis it's good against jeskai though which is probably reason enough to run it 
15314.0,20f84f86d60e426d071054137bdf7d30cb94ede9,in the board

15354.0,438b5bc5acde917a83c4916a4150cc280d3215be,do you think that immortal sun is a good enough card in any aspect such as a mid range rather than a mostly control style deck 
15393.0,053756b8f8943640591e4da42012a74887517f85,jettcooper its a good card i think but it might have more answers than it should to be good 
15393.0,1e580584ae6899a2bc57de8fc0dc81de30337940,438b5bc5acde917a83c4916a4150cc280d3215be imortal sun stopps active not static abilities so its situational imo 
15420.0,20f84f86d60e426d071054137bdf7d30cb94ede9,well i have good news - you have 2 turns before it's over :p

15481.0,053756b8f8943640591e4da42012a74887517f85,ugin is really good it creates card advantage

15561.0,20f84f86d60e426d071054137bdf7d30cb94ede9,nissa's just much better because if she goes unanswered she doubles your mana 
15565.0,fc14f2a11be88401280898add6435d3ce962821c,i'd consider ugin over dawn of hope 
15566.0,7aa837caef96298c4a40c391b2d0ff5a0f3f6865,yeah 20f84f86d60e426d071054137bdf7d30cb94ede9 i didnt realize it's instant

15584.0,9a3eca664eaf1d90e5f7cd99ffbdc7b96cd905da,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 is the deafening clarion less good with nissa's 3/3 lands 
15585.0,ff151c45502bdc17b6cf444456a4b773c3140766,1f859094fe544482772c9ae1ce47db03d78e13e3 perhaps 1 or 2 ugin is correct
