138.0,5f66caa96fe9c4fca225bf9676ba9f0c5b119454,32 v 32 is meant for casual 
139.0,2db7be4ee63e339f6b6292e15e5697d0db84c7db,yeah the triple stacking try hard in normals kinda defeats the purpose of normals lol but ranked is pretty bad 
141.0,614e22436b535b9e28c22424705395e940c430b6,but i mean me and my bois triple stack in casuals too and we're like 10k+ each but rank is just terrible so what are we supposed to do

180.0,9f64b29c3f675bb135d0fd505a86842c85dca84c,its unbalanced because stacks of 3 players trying hard in discord are matched against solo players in normal games its just not possible to do anything against that as a solo 
183.0,235c17616418d0e7a5e0680576fdde0c4adcbadd,how can apex do it

207.0,614e22436b535b9e28c22424705395e940c430b6,all i would play is solos then ranked with my team instead of casual squads 
213.0,614e22436b535b9e28c22424705395e940c430b6,but there's literally no alternative

245.0,9f64b29c3f675bb135d0fd505a86842c85dca84c,solo was chill because 1v1 even against a very good player is much easier than a 1 v 3 against average players
