12409.0,15f9e19a44d3f782491b2e0f12900e7889fa6806,condemn vs whirlwind which would win lol 
12425.0,54e9b2e5858ba314a0cc9c46625ab7df524594e6,i completed the season journey got ~700 paragon got a useless primal you know the typical seasonal experience seemsgood 
12564.0,54e9b2e5858ba314a0cc9c46625ab7df524594e6,well i'm sorry but the game is stale it's the same old shit as it was last season and the one before laurcureee 
12595.0,4c80aa6ec2963a5ebf54c0d4b37e2985264dea2b,well i don't know if it's useless but my first primal on my second account was a templar relic 
12636.0,77579e7697a09b682c6d96b6f04cbdf504cd4c2e,i mean the game is almost 8 years old what do people want 
12653.0,808a3e32efcab67e8203e7e7e54c1857d637b659,we can expect new playstyles with the new sets but i dont think the endgame itself will change it will be neph rifts + grs + bounties till the end of time i think 
12663.0,4c80aa6ec2963a5ebf54c0d4b37e2985264dea2b,i wanted to shard it in spite :) 
12666.0,54e9b2e5858ba314a0cc9c46625ab7df524594e6,i'd prefer a slower grind to the stuff we have now day one you can have people with almost 1k paragon ffs 
12693.0,77579e7697a09b682c6d96b6f04cbdf504cd4c2e,i'm blown the fuck away that we're getting new sets i thought the game was done put a fork in it

12919.0,77579e7697a09b682c6d96b6f04cbdf504cd4c2e,agree minimum of 2 
12927.0,ab49a43f1c08541ba8ef6315aaa28463982b381b,1 per season would be over almost 2 years tho 
12972.0,81516e14900fe1a01eb219f227be2a688b6e4e07,i expect them to release two no matter how much work is done just to milk it and get away with the least amount of content as possible 
13170.0,81516e14900fe1a01eb219f227be2a688b6e4e07,they used to be in an outstanding position wow is rank 1 mmorpg starcraft is the top rts diablo was the top action rpg but diablo has dropped compared to newer arrivals and starcraft is just too old for people to care 
13228.0,54e9b2e5858ba314a0cc9c46625ab7df524594e6,diablo fans are a bonus not a main focus 
13264.0,54e9b2e5858ba314a0cc9c46625ab7df524594e6,which is fine since the game has pretty much made most of the money it was gonna make anyway 
13271.0,81516e14900fe1a01eb219f227be2a688b6e4e07,how much planning does it take to turn all the numbers up
