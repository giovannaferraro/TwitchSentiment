334.0,a2dbdfd5df8072561487e71648b5c99b7831a50a,ea1896b1ece1e06904f1657579e0f44c6db0f15f when the trebuchet is low rank it is really inaccurate and has low ammo by default if you increase the cunning of the general whos retinue it belongs to you get more ammunnition and explosive shot is amazing against blobs of infantry literally can get hundreds of kills in a direct hit volley 
343.0,88194303b8439a697fb8f2ad79257de31f59335d,this army monkas

390.0,51729f74462a3fb0b2c0fdc6b4dcf2e348197d76,a2dbdfd5df8072561487e71648b5c99b7831a50a also if you use explosive shot it leaves a little fire that if someone behind the main target walks through it they die 
403.0,e869921135f8ffed1a5b22a26b8d7bc1489f973a,probably bad vs cavalry id imagine due to the innacuracy 
404.0,d316a317113e17fd03f78adeb2b485056f1d6906,are the people gettin bodied out there just chillin 
406.0,0ed1760bdebe0938d5e8a1bc3e0b213eb56f8afc,explosive ammo is supposed to be less accurate if i remember correctly 
409.0,a2dbdfd5df8072561487e71648b5c99b7831a50a,ea1896b1ece1e06904f1657579e0f44c6db0f15f more or less in certain situations the default shot is better against cav 
410.0,d90e5e5aad61409ff0dba32f21323f157cfe94a4,normal ammo has more armor penetration better for higher armour targets 
418.0,51729f74462a3fb0b2c0fdc6b4dcf2e348197d76,single shot is better for buildings explosive for troops

499.0,51729f74462a3fb0b2c0fdc6b4dcf2e348197d76,ea1896b1ece1e06904f1657579e0f44c6db0f15f the more ammo you get means more consistent damage when you have a higher level on the trebuchet the dot from the fire < more 1 8~k damage shots 
501.0,a2dbdfd5df8072561487e71648b5c99b7831a50a,ea1896b1ece1e06904f1657579e0f44c6db0f15f also explosive shot is not always available since its locked behind a skill and yes explosive is better against buildings especially towers since after you hit them once or twice they burn down and take any wooden structure with them in a blaze
