9610.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,most people quit after a week anyways 
9616.0,1e88e6319cfd364fdb288e1fc36ef3345cf4798c,the thing about botters is that they have the ability to do it 24 hours a day

9629.0,1e88e6319cfd364fdb288e1fc36ef3345cf4798c,it's hard for a fully legit player to sustain 24 hours a day

9654.0,211c4eb2bdeb3d483f71a72d977edf259df10c18,yeah legit players verse botters if they only get ahead by lets say 200 para its not as big of a jump as 3 month season and them having 2k para 
9657.0,5dee4f1104343cd58a5d703a93f7741d97722c2b,i mean i don't think just the shorter season would eliminate the prob but it would help i agree i think if there was a 6 week season and a ban wave 4 weeks into each season then botters would be heavily knee capped 
9666.0,5dee4f1104343cd58a5d703a93f7741d97722c2b,211c4eb2bdeb3d483f71a72d977edf259df10c18 i see 
9667.0,530624b1b028333c3ca5dfae51575f7be8bc1180,they remove paragon i have no reason to play after opening night

10859.0,86c0e9a621b8c28ced68b86e45002358884456ed,and that's only problematic where the end game success is mostly defined by the grind rather than skill

24585.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,a big part of what makes classic goos is its insane annoyance which somehowcreates immersion

24819.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,while also making a serious gamer feel like they get some incentive for playing more than anyone els 
24823.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,challenging is ok time consuming is bigger imo 
24950.0,2f6ef62c7b02a7457866f73ff97470caf5a39e20,dark souls might actually be the best game of this decade no other game comes to mind as being that good and influential in 2010s 
25007.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,yea was mostly talking about like the going for top ten on leader board its not really challenging is more just time consuming the was d3 is set up 
25014.0,897a3473c30ec40f17eeb2a22bc119b32610b060,82a0aa2d6e799990d850f27307bbef6b433d13a7 dude artifact farming has an end you can reach paragon farming doesnt

25119.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,it could be the best game ever but without re-playability its a game that dies as soon as it starts 
25130.0,f00e33636e9cade3853c851e1fd46764f52d1ba5,highest paragon is 10k right 
25132.0,b120c957ff7da06bb9882e9f3280125d42ac2e1c,they just need to buff solo paragon 
25138.0,897a3473c30ec40f17eeb2a22bc119b32610b060,f00e33636e9cade3853c851e1fd46764f52d1ba5 no

25195.0,897a3473c30ec40f17eeb2a22bc119b32610b060,and i mean currently it bis item with socket is perfect enough 
25217.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,non-season is above 10k i think 
25247.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,season is like 4800 
25271.0,897a3473c30ec40f17eeb2a22bc119b32610b060,the stat diffrence isnt even in the whole % damage output 
25297.0,897a3473c30ec40f17eeb2a22bc119b32610b060,between socket bis and current max ilvl with socket 
25303.0,897a3473c30ec40f17eeb2a22bc119b32610b060,its 4% dps diffrence 
25358.0,897a3473c30ec40f17eeb2a22bc119b32610b060,to be fair 
25364.0,897a3473c30ec40f17eeb2a22bc119b32610b060,they should limit titan forging 
25376.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,when you getting your lionheart helm

25418.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,i quit in cata and never looked back 
25490.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,it's a what item 
25517.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,oh ye didn't hear you 
25532.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,warrior seems so expensive to gear 
25561.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,how is plate a noun and a verb 
25573.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,lionheart is like 800g with craft fee isn't it 
25599.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,when a chef says plate that meal 
25628.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,i plate you 
25637.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,it would ina sense just be puting something on a plate that is plating it 
25653.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,also the action of plating steel with chrome or nickel 
25714.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,like gold plated 
25722.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,is that a verb 
25750.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,gold plated as a description is a noun but the action of plating the item with gold is the verb 
25821.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,gotta what also strikes me and mazes me is how many maps and how many areas and specific little caves or whatnot i'm each map it's kinda crazy 
25833.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,like vanilla wow is a huuuge game 
25853.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,in each* 
25923.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,i feel that a game that is designed to be an open world game with wonderful scenic shouldnt have fast travel but i also find myself using it because of time 
25986.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,hence mounts lol 
25992.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,that is the middle ground 
25998.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,yeah and you can make a good arguement for a feel or mood but it's there and can't always explain it 
26017.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,so if something makes sense logical but ruins a mood or feel it's bad 
26068.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,can't** 
26103.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,that made its way inot eso as well but if you have to get all the fast travels yourself with no help it would take at least a week of 10 hour days 
26205.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,like the biggest thing i hate with classic so far is walking everywhere before 49 but i bet if you got mounts are lvl1 it would be worse 
26218.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,40* 
26221.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,for the game 
26334.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,here's a question 
26363.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,if wow never existed and vanilla wow came out now just like it did do you think it would be successful 
26378.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,i'm 2019 
26384.0,2f6ef62c7b02a7457866f73ff97470caf5a39e20,well apparently d4 was scraped and restarted in 2016 and i don't think 3 years is enough time to finalize a big blizz game they can still change anything 
26396.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,not a chance 
26402.0,2f6ef62c7b02a7457866f73ff97470caf5a39e20,scrapped* 
26418.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,i think it would flop too 
26481.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,i hope d4 implements pay for inventory expansions and organized tabs like path as well i would like to see pay for transmog items and wings and such this wll create a great market for the game and as such they will be more willing to invest time into development since it will actually be netting them income vs the current business model where they only make money from the initial purchase 
26546.0,2f6ef62c7b02a7457866f73ff97470caf5a39e20,pay for inventory sure but if it's still going to have an initial $60 price then it should be way bigger than poe 
26555.0,2f6ef62c7b02a7457866f73ff97470caf5a39e20,like the base inventory 
26568.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,not really imo just imagine a new company coming out with vanilla wow right now 
26572.0,2f6ef62c7b02a7457866f73ff97470caf5a39e20,poe is pretty much a free trial with only 4 stash tabs when you get to endgame you have to pay for more 
26580.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,i'm saying let's say it wasn't even called wow no connection to warcraft but same game 
26638.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,i don't think ppl would resonate with the type of game 
26644.0,2f6ef62c7b02a7457866f73ff97470caf5a39e20,yeah currency + map tab is like $30 that's the actual price of the game imo if not even more 
26701.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,so it would flop 
26763.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,but i don't think most of the new players playing classic give a shit about warcraft 
26769.0,4c80aa6ec2963a5ebf54c0d4b37e2985264dea2b,even though poe is free to play the fact they make your gear look like a hobo clown that rolled out of a dumpster just for the propose of forcing you to buy transmog is why i stopped playing it now going for extra transmog like wings and ground effects those are something i have no problem being pay for items 
26771.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,i think it would flop either way 
26801.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,i think so too 
26805.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,most of the new players quit already 
26816.0,2f6ef62c7b02a7457866f73ff97470caf5a39e20,i don't think it'd flop but it'd be way more niche mmo fans are so hungry for new mmos that they'd play anyhting even crappy korean p2w mmos spike at release 
26836.0,a8337d81451ea78914636918379293ffe45ad376,welp i might tank the guilds group 2 raid as a paladin /flex 
26879.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,and some of the items arent even 3d 
26912.0,a8337d81451ea78914636918379293ffe45ad376,apparently one of em asked if i was able to do it 
26916.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,idk if most new players quit 
26945.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,obviously some 
26950.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,yes for sure im saying the new people that have never played before 
26974.0,cc5d936286dffa512b88df78aa72bae73f80e8cf,halo music laurcugains laurcuapproved 
26984.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,like the people that tried it and quit account for a lot of them 
26987.0,a8337d81451ea78914636918379293ffe45ad376,id play the shit out of ddo if it didnt look like shit 
26994.0,2f6ef62c7b02a7457866f73ff97470caf5a39e20,4c80aa6ec2963a5ebf54c0d4b37e2985264dea2b agree that's one of the major downsides of the game for me your character looks like crap from level 1 to 100 if you don't buy skins but with skins there's no progression you look godly from the start and they're mostly way over the top 
26997.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,you think most of ppl who started wow with classic quit 
27009.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,who knows 
27015.0,1a30bb585019b50d6d1d48fd516d4042bb684b90,ddo 
27186.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,ehh its free so i dont mind it 
27189.0,ac4da6139ac07829891e9ed8555b351a003366d3,yeah transmog is just another example of a cool convenience system that seems awesome yet ultimately takes away from a game 
27239.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,would be cool if there was a free way to get a premium stash tab or a crappy matching armor tho 
27242.0,4c80aa6ec2963a5ebf54c0d4b37e2985264dea2b,2f6ef62c7b02a7457866f73ff97470caf5a39e20 i payed for my much needed tabs but even if they allowed simple transmog with the found gear the way d3 an many other games allow i'd be happy with that that's the extent of my 2 cent's on the subject :p 
27286.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,i run speed 90's with a raekor ss barb that wears a corrupted ashbringer all the time because i think it looks amazing and its the only weapon in the game that can not be transmogged to look like anything else as well nothing can be transmogged to look like it lol 
27308.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,ps his name is mograine lik

27363.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,yea have to pay to transmog ground gear too 
27427.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,yeah it's almost like they wanted it to be as powerful as wow lore but then ros came out and anything that wasnt set became shyt lol 
27502.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,came in 2 2 0 
27509.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,yeah ashbring has never gotten a rework tho and it literally has a 5k+ bonus damage spec on it 
27524.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,lon/lod is the only real way 
27543.0,c156cc17ae18d228f16d662e4e7c5d53601bcdf8,overtime effects would be cool 
27546.0,0c77f824627f194d18a2c06ae5ca7e7974843537,yeah but ashbringer is on kill based too not on hit

28714.0,2f6ef62c7b02a7457866f73ff97470caf5a39e20,i like poe's maps for the random modifiers and 100+ different bosses and layouts but i don't like that you end up grinding the same map which means same layout and boss for pretty much 100s of hours
