981.0,f4af044c696a45d4ef55d590216b65135ac797fb,shadowborn apostle {b} creature â€” human cleric 1/1 a deck can have any number of cards named shadowborn apostle / {b} sacrifice six creatures named shadowborn apostle: search your library for a demon creature card and put it onto the battlefield then shuffle your library 
984.0,48bb5cf3532594982ed7829cd5064e0009a14fc1,when i play against esper they always have t3 teferi when i play i never do etc etc

1011.0,949882d423086355e1b4ca50165d62d991cd242c,frilled mystic with ramp is a killer for this deck gotta have the good and put down a tef first or they'll eat the heavy cmc spells 
1013.0,60f3d5b4ad83f1a87a9b53b2b5844d1990484764,8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f i'm having a few issues with your jeskaisuperfriends deck vs rdw and iwas wondiering if putting in intervention might be a decent sideboard card since theres no real lifegain in the deck 
1016.0,4c3fa15ac12a382e5daa10801152d84fad068688,3 mana draw spell

1106.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,well then 
1110.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,never did not have it 
1111.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,i've never seen tamiyo draw two 
1112.0,9b71e9f7489d961dda3cda0efd30f1ca9929412b,or 2 alternatively 
1112.0,81538d184004f8765a25676135e45a2c63fd2daa,found em 
1119.0,eaff4c58f6a5811c9a173e3e6bf4a8133e77e9d2,free divination seemsgood 
1131.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,it might be worth taking a turn off with tamiyo to pull back either another tamiyo or a dreadhorde 
1133.0,f4af044c696a45d4ef55d590216b65135ac797fb,did you know that if you have amazon prime you have a free twitch subscription you can use you should consider supporting jeff and subscribe to the channel just link your twitch account to your amazon account by clicking here: https://twitch amazon com/prime

1172.0,d522a8b623adc922b0ed70eff1776151e89abf4b,haha 
1176.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,well that is why my first suggestion was the other tamiyo not dreadhorde 
1194.0,e56ce561e44974fa367053a5954c580c9a8585f0,i think we just ignore the walkers and elderspell them and hit their face 
1200.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,if we had a walker in hand dreadhorde is the right play otherwise we need walker before we do iit 
1217.0,321fc2cc034b9e72693e7b2f2a311267446b4384,more counterspell 
1222.0,1b7729dbe58bb1109674effb59a7e77e867c6ae4,i found against simic mass manip its always smart to tick down tamiyo otherwise it rebuys mass manip lul 
1258.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,if the only threat they are presenting is a mass manipulation the ability to replay tamiyo after they take it seemed significant to me to help you continue to dig after 
1264.0,c107c19d244cce55a45d4bc917c0e14bf27d7a38,i wish magic was about clicking random buttons 
1291.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,no because the tamiyo doesn't have enough loyalty right 
1295.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,that is what i was saying 
1297.0,1b7729dbe58bb1109674effb59a7e77e867c6ae4,ding gabysip 
1301.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,and i think stalling is better for you over them 
1337.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,i love how 3feri's voice lines are like a sitcom character

1369.0,7e0160ef21ceaa42628a18bbae17aca41648f449,:( 
1377.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,at the end of the day your play pulled you through several mass manips so it was probably better anyway

1381.0,4c3fa15ac12a382e5daa10801152d84fad068688,well then 
1409.0,7e0160ef21ceaa42628a18bbae17aca41648f449,decks that are bad vs frilled mystic are alilyyikes 
1419.0,87fc5bb6742a2f95ab2d2337e7756b6b909c0817,mass manipulation feels really good vs these mid range decks almost unbeatable sometimes 
1438.0,4adea6d8afa8d9df21f6d3821189aa0b7d379f3d,not a lot of decks come back against manipulation to be fair most get under it oder counter it 
1445.0,562a18b218a31aeb95ba7deabc9cd56f110a0264,update stream title 
1457.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,stream title is fine

1476.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,in general it's not though right since you have a bunch of 3feri that mean their mystics do nothing 
1493.0,e4eb40033b8420927cb95bc8177d343f500dc985,update title for what did i miss something 
1496.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,i guess jeskai lists are running syncopates in the face of dreadhorde

1560.0,55cfc0887d6b0e08360c09f6804a62194c38da7c,worst draw 
1563.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,that might well be the worst draw in your deck here 
1564.0,ccb301c15a5d501d6590eed646ae3a71b3ba2b1d,8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f could you explain this decks goal for me please like i think i get it but im not sure 
1569.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,s'a 5/5 that can't block

1600.0,06e6a9a979464ac9d79db1aa7b7e435ffcbdd514,i meant mass manipulation and dread in your decm 
1603.0,03008aca4787c9fe297d1af81cc0ca41ed50b503,the whole amass mechanic cries because teferi exists

1605.0,0c3357ba797579d5d4e8984a87484029145c8d8c,i could see that syncopate checks cast phoenixes 
1621.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,wow opponent's deck would die to a 3feri 
1632.0,55cfc0887d6b0e08360c09f6804a62194c38da7c,4/3 pheonix 
1640.0,71f15c439bbe1bab4d3ecfa45dfc63bcd367188a,right nameless here's this mechanic that spends a lot of time to build up a single huge token and teferi is 3 mana nullifying that and drawing a card to boot 
1642.0,0c3357ba797579d5d4e8984a87484029145c8d8c,rekindling as well exiles them when you counter them on cast 
1645.0,55cfc0887d6b0e08360c09f6804a62194c38da7c,i dunno 
1657.0,ccb301c15a5d501d6590eed646ae3a71b3ba2b1d,8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f does this deck have good win rates in the meta 
1665.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,i mean if you counter phoenix it usually just dies forever 
1692.0,f218458d90b657331d5763b1e421273b02e95efd,i had data once on a convenient website told me every match that was played 
1700.0,ccb301c15a5d501d6590eed646ae3a71b3ba2b1d,seems like a hard deck to play 
1706.0,1df9c0d6612bc4603f971c45054964d3b195775d,hopefully we will get some indication in the future with apps like untapped etc 
1711.0,bf140ba04e153dc080745d990d58aa68b4c0b996,man it doesn't seem like weve seen much out of this deck 
1732.0,276174d543a78d99610edf13f8f84ab20a63f51d,i have been playing it lately 
1733.0,4fd7d65204c1998ec7d86823dd3accdfa1258b14,someone argued with me over facebook about how they said mtg goldfish gets all of wotcs arena data and that how they make their arena metagame lists 
1736.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,do you feel like the 3c version is better

1739.0,b2863b686cfdcf0ca4db60ffa368eb400e60dca0,your ranting on no one has the data makes me want to develop a platform that aggragates data from arena logs to actually get the data jeff

1762.0,9b71e9f7489d961dda3cda0efd30f1ca9929412b,yeah this deck is supposed to break the midrange mirrors but any midrange deck with an aggressive slant and disruption seems like it'll just go right under you 
1764.0,81538d184004f8765a25676135e45a2c63fd2daa,8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f the proper way to off yourself with dreadhorde in hand is pull everything out of all the yards 
1766.0,f9ba27069fe938d938fb57708b6a304f20b98ae0,^actual statistics get out

1778.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,this jeskia list seems way more controling than other ones we have seen recently 
1792.0,7e0160ef21ceaa42628a18bbae17aca41648f449,everyone in twitch chat acting like putting tefer3 in your deck give you a passive emblem turn 0]\ 
1796.0,b2863b686cfdcf0ca4db60ffa368eb400e60dca0,that's the other reason i don't wanna do it dimirspy 
1808.0,84c5eac64ba70f6765091f266a2181bc55373387,not dreadhording yourself to death is a misplay 
1812.0,03008aca4787c9fe297d1af81cc0ca41ed50b503,statistics math is for opponents dansgame

1830.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,or steal it like what they did 
1831.0,eaff4c58f6a5811c9a173e3e6bf4a8133e77e9d2,my opponent did that last night i had a revealed counter in hand and they didn't do maths i checked their selection and let the dreadhorde resolve and won 
1835.0,ccb301c15a5d501d6590eed646ae3a71b3ba2b1d,the best thing small tef does is enable a draw step erasure 
1838.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,it doesn't but it puts a huge amount of pressure on your opp to have one part of this is my playing it in nexus i guess 
1863.0,2e9200dedf3f98b08420814489e9e63a6b0313f8,one more month until our bezo baby lul 
1880.0,9b71e9f7489d961dda3cda0efd30f1ca9929412b,it might be anecdotal but we've definitely been playing a lot of guildgates today the fact that interplanar beacon doesn't turn on our buddies might be reason enough to go up on shocks 
1883.0,ac0d6a4716a7f405ab6120a08510dfaecd102bef,8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f was it the same huh i think there was a kaya before that you didn't love i'd been playing with two sorins and it felt good 
1909.0,0d6acd7620e770667c68b81b8e50a0a22fbe4a10,beard is looking good 
1920.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,i feel syncopate becomes veto post board in this mtchup especially on the draw 
1920.0,997d0e64c3085f68154ac51a56cd5874d91e3a0e,you vant win against the counter spells

1926.0,6d768cff9e5299140be647bca18b716c1f110ee5,just played a dreadhorde as gr sarkhan loved having a ton of interaction to keep wgw from gaining life so i could kill em before dreadhorde 
1949.0,f9ba27069fe938d938fb57708b6a304f20b98ae0,ooh no counters 
1964.0,4fd7d65204c1998ec7d86823dd3accdfa1258b14,is it just me or does the deck seem kind of clunky especially when there are well oiled machines like mono red out there 
1968.0,5d744ee04e642e261df9d640a365f8cab79ec0cc,self mill with tamiyo first 
1969.0,81538d184004f8765a25676135e45a2c63fd2daa,i would like to command all of them

1994.0,574abecb950b991b4689c3e9f355060e061da0fa,50% of the time this deck works everytime 
2016.0,81538d184004f8765a25676135e45a2c63fd2daa,i'm a fan of exploring then naming the card i leave on top with tamiyo guaranteed draw with upside of drawing extra copies is nice 
2017.0,6d768cff9e5299140be647bca18b716c1f110ee5,yup yup put 4 of ls in kept 2 shocks as well mb against rdw so i have more ways to kill steamkin game 1 
2022.0,b878e8c5ad32a604c0a7fa9c87059c4ce6e4d72c,just switch it to a different one rage 
2024.0,e1bec1ed4f9f72befa9fab4c73de54400439e870,i think a large amount of people's complaints about 3feri is just the psychological emphasis that negative events have on people 
2027.0,eaff4c58f6a5811c9a173e3e6bf4a8133e77e9d2,945333a802d55d472a81cd515b73d870543f026d lol you can probably convert your points to another deck

2047.0,f328ea14e7f6a791ed5a0a166a53c0528407a6fc,how are the decks going today jeff 
2054.0,8d8b2a4a6b4a45fa9e88caafd6625f0e2e39f554,how many times a day do you think jeff calls something clunky 
2056.0,b878e8c5ad32a604c0a7fa9c87059c4ce6e4d72c,like switch it out for another deck you have 
2059.0,949882d423086355e1b4ca50165d62d991cd242c,this deck is like ~40% against aggro you need a specific curve to outpace and can easily just draw the wrong half 
2061.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,i think my matchups against 3feri massively improved when i cut multiple counterspells from my 75 
2070.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,and put in cards that answer it when resolved instead 
2078.0,945333a802d55d472a81cd515b73d870543f026d,8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f play the br aristocrats im loving that deck 
2084.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,rdws is the only deck i lost against with my take on 4c dreadhorde even beat several nexus in a row but i fell off the deck pretty quickly not because it was bad but because the mirrors suck the games are long and i really just wanted to hit people in the face with dinos 
2086.0,574abecb950b991b4689c3e9f355060e061da0fa,getting used to playing against 3feri was definitely trial by fire as a control player too used to casting instants on my opponent's turn :face_with_tears_of_joy: 
2097.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,people playing non foil opts and shocks is a disgraace to wizards sympathy they are free foils people

2117.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,i pushed it up today to see if jeff felt the same way 
2145.0,a983ebca06d87b13dd6dcc0b6e9f3604273b1c03,they'll never expect the third tamiyo 
2164.0,f9ba27069fe938d938fb57708b6a304f20b98ae0,eventually one of those tamiyos gotta stick right

2185.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,she can pull lands out of the graveyard 
2188.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,i think this is commence ye 
2194.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,another option was to dig so we can pick up a land from grave next turn 
2269.0,997d0e64c3085f68154ac51a56cd5874d91e3a0e,counter spells ruin all the damn fun 
2270.0,94275b549a079f356fb8fc7f301f4cc7a06ae499,is sentinal totem or silent gravestone good against the command the dreadhorde decks 
2280.0,997d0e64c3085f68154ac51a56cd5874d91e3a0e,what an annoying thing 
2292.0,d522a8b623adc922b0ed70eff1776151e89abf4b,what are they playing 
2294.0,84c5eac64ba70f6765091f266a2181bc55373387,opp feels bold running that many insights in a world full of narset 
2295.0,eaff4c58f6a5811c9a173e3e6bf4a8133e77e9d2,we weren't thirsty opponent 
2304.0,ccb301c15a5d501d6590eed646ae3a71b3ba2b1d,i would say 94275b549a079f356fb8fc7f301f4cc7a06ae499 
2318.0,d522a8b623adc922b0ed70eff1776151e89abf4b,is it just jeskai control 
2319.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,i think their plan is literally just never let the hatewalkers resolve 
2332.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,opponents deck seems so crazy greedy wonder how it fairs against aggressive decks if there is a good jeskia control list in the format i would like to play it 
2332.0,2ba56b8b48ff2f46bbb32f03586eea953b9a620c,this deck feels like it is always playing catch up pure control usually feels that way but you have a steady turn of the corner this deck has to turn the corner in one turn or it is over 
2335.0,fe4116b9b68e71582e5777bb24483388f18797df,so they have access to syncopate/quench/spell pierce/veto/absorb/negate what else am i missing chat 
2340.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,seems like a rough time against esper but if that's gone 
2342.0,06e6a9a979464ac9d79db1aa7b7e435ffcbdd514,wow 
2347.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,opp is running enough counters to counter 3tef and narset so i guess they play insights due to that 
2350.0,574abecb950b991b4689c3e9f355060e061da0fa,beacon was actually a good draw there gives us one more turn if they have no burn 
2362.0,e4eb40033b8420927cb95bc8177d343f500dc985,jeskai control + endgame interesting 
2363.0,a983ebca06d87b13dd6dcc0b6e9f3604273b1c03,yeah i mean if your entire deck is draw spells counterspells and commence the endgame 
2368.0,f9ba27069fe938d938fb57708b6a304f20b98ae0,fe4116b9b68e71582e5777bb24483388f18797df is plain old cancel still legal

2413.0,f14b3e02fffbe02346b102bafc9a9437705433c3,opponent's deck seems sweet on paper it seems like it would be poorly positioned in the format but they're playing it really well 
2457.0,06d7a43799fd68d33949387dfca78731fb4de05b,hi jeff hi chat 
2462.0,13b4dd5cecd1ea78272c1fa2f7abb9278a694f3b,that one dies pretty readily to agro seems like

2471.0,0245cd3fe83ee69843da4185aa5f58631144068e,but baby tef being what he is the mono-counterspell decks aren't all that popular i don't know how useful this datapoint is 
2471.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,they have a serious problem on the draw with taplands or against elf teferi 
2474.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,their deck probably concedes to a basic mountain turn 1 
2475.0,08e907d5d7d942256c3000fe6359aaa1c00a3641,not being able to double spell was killin us 
2500.0,bebb4c9069440e92dcf7598de8081eb36d3f9fbc,incredibly clunky and awkward: 4 color standard decks and you 
2503.0,7e0160ef21ceaa42628a18bbae17aca41648f449,this whole format gets stuffed by counterspells if time raveler isn't in play 
2514.0,4adea6d8afa8d9df21f6d3821189aa0b7d379f3d,mono red is fine against counters 
2516.0,172a005f6e95f13362fff8fef1aca5a95e833f9e,i'm so happy to have the deck editor support different basic arts again 
2519.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,not 19 basic mountains

2546.0,84c5eac64ba70f6765091f266a2181bc55373387,time raveler seems like a sneaky key card in this deck 
2556.0,f45877dc35e167e944fcc5b5a18fdb9d79b4a63f,decks like this is why i enjoy mono red and rakdos aristocrats - smooth and consistent manabase/gameplan to punish all the 3-4 color decks right now

2741.0,b322cc4cd41d7c4be601fa162c8492579794f3a2,this deck seems very good at going over the top of all the other midrange decks but seems week to aggro in general and bad against control without baby teferi in play

2761.0,7f53e81a184834444fd502dac0c8128ad613d559,this deck looks sweet when it works but so clunky when it doesnt 
2768.0,d522a8b623adc922b0ed70eff1776151e89abf4b,in paper a judge gave me a warning for not naming a modern legal card during a modern game 
2769.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,we have dreadhorde in grave right

2799.0,559d92fdbbf0c6c3c7c532084dc3015bb539d443,yea i dont think ill change my opinion on the deck based on the 2-3 bad games right now 
2830.0,a983ebca06d87b13dd6dcc0b6e9f3604273b1c03,comp rules 201 3 says it has to be legal in the format you're playing 
2880.0,9ee2c7947b0d89803cc2ac70d4935533741fe535,the explore package can usually line up pretty well against aggro 
2884.0,b322cc4cd41d7c4be601fa162c8492579794f3a2,i will say this deck generates very satisfying wins with boards like this :) 
2904.0,08e907d5d7d942256c3000fe6359aaa1c00a3641,this format rewards proactivity which is rb is better at 
2905.0,3ef25166484b5913d1e71c742fa9b97664b0fe44,eaff4c58f6a5811c9a173e3e6bf4a8133e77e9d2 that's okay i was just curious something funny to do in paper like name force of will 
2907.0,4adea6d8afa8d9df21f6d3821189aa0b7d379f3d,the currently played control decks have very few counters to be fair i think that jeskai control mage is more an anomaly 
2911.0,559d92fdbbf0c6c3c7c532084dc3015bb539d443,i agree its not good against aggro and the amount of times i have run into large amounts of counter based control is very narrow 
2916.0,559d92fdbbf0c6c3c7c532084dc3015bb539d443,maybe that will change though 
2917.0,1b7729dbe58bb1109674effb59a7e77e867c6ae4,a983ebca06d87b13dd6dcc0b6e9f3604273b1c03 where are you reading this i dont see that in the comp rules do you have an old version 
2925.0,7f53e81a184834444fd502dac0c8128ad613d559,preach it 8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f 
2930.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,well i played bw from plat to diamond and didnt lose once felt really good to me played br aristo from diamond to mythic had some losses but not much got to mythic played some more games with bw and it felt way worse after playing the br version

2974.0,bebb4c9069440e92dcf7598de8081eb36d3f9fbc,this deck didn't even feel all that consistent even when you were winning the other day often you find yourself mana-screwed then unscrew then win when you draw the good well finally 
2974.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,i agree with your opinion about this decks position in the meta with one exception i think it is good against nexus post side board with narset brontodon teferi bounces and lots of ways to replay all of them and if you do not get those cards that means you drew your creatures and are beating them to death but as we saw against jeskia control it is bad against real control decks

3314.0,7a62c676314c629a52c90c33024eb954499bfe3a,it looks like this deck kind of relies on counter spell decks being pushed out by other teferi decks

3437.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,i think digging for teferi was the correct play

3471.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,no we feel like we either dig for dreadhorde so we can get little tef and narset back or big tef to have an answer to ooze 
3475.0,e4eb40033b8420927cb95bc8177d343f500dc985,isn't cabal therapy just a labotomy

3641.0,81538d184004f8765a25676135e45a2c63fd2daa,kraul harpooner 
3653.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,i do not feel like this deck ever hits the wrong half problem vs nexus your walkers shut nexus down and your creatures just kill them so no matter which half you hit you are fine 
3653.0,44932b7f7b8b476f5298d2f8465ddd59889d97ca,for me 4c dread really makes tamiyo shine thats my main attraction to it

3667.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,though i will concead that you really really want tef3 the matcup hinges on him in a lot of ways

3766.0,49165d34d4484c9ecbc482f19134160f6e4a1776,so it's kinda like the 3 color aggro decks strong when it hits but too inconsistent

3781.0,7e0160ef21ceaa42628a18bbae17aca41648f449,before they were supposed to be on the holding companies server so that's probably broken

3865.0,bf140ba04e153dc080745d990d58aa68b4c0b996,esper aggro is something i have never seen 
3876.0,bf140ba04e153dc080745d990d58aa68b4c0b996,and not something i thought i would ever see 
3886.0,eaff4c58f6a5811c9a173e3e6bf4a8133e77e9d2,10c96861287ba8411d4c68033e4a9d754f72d2cf too true

3909.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,i feel like this deck needs to find some space for some one drops for curve reasons and dauntless bodyguard seems good 
3909.0,826883c5753ce4d447ebf76513a54326e30df2c4,so we can expect missed land drops right 
3915.0,1e54f77adef029c64156db605669c84c59738d7f,8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f so in your objective opinion what's better citadel or dreadhorde 
3917.0,497f144715c12f5923cc3e5d6a91f4eb9845b804,oh that thief is so pretty 8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f 
3920.0,9b71e9f7489d961dda3cda0efd30f1ca9929412b,i've been playing a similar deck to this with a slightly higher curve and the knights have been standout brilliant 
3929.0,9ee2c7947b0d89803cc2ac70d4935533741fe535,i picked up a history with time raveler the other day when my board was stalled and it was cute 
3930.0,eaff4c58f6a5811c9a173e3e6bf4a8133e77e9d2,lets avoid some cry of carnarium's 
3932.0,03008aca4787c9fe297d1af81cc0ca41ed50b503,it's a teferi deck nice i love those 
3944.0,5cbefb57e58578f5d21e962b60c40596cfbe4c83,poor esper decks sidelined to the unbanked queue 
3953.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,well missing land drops isnt as bad for the low costs of this deck as well 
3954.0,bebb4c9069440e92dcf7598de8081eb36d3f9fbc,curving a knight of grace/malice into a thief and forcing op to choose which one to remove sounds real nice 
3955.0,eaff4c58f6a5811c9a173e3e6bf4a8133e77e9d2,someone was worried about lands haha 
3957.0,cc6b441473214bb941d00ffff3070f6d99c1293d,reminds me of the lyev skyknight deck from way back 
3960.0,ffcea4fe926b96019433ec6016e0cac3ae69ded4,i'm soooo glad protection is gone 
3963.0,f14b3e02fffbe02346b102bafc9a9437705433c3,knight of malice as a 2-mana play that doesn't get bounced by 3feri sounds pretty sweet in this format 
3965.0,e1bec1ed4f9f72befa9fab4c73de54400439e870,wait is there no foil for knight of malice 
3971.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,while esper control runs 4 and 5 drops as their main threats 
3980.0,9ee2c7947b0d89803cc2ac70d4935533741fe535,f14b3e02fffbe02346b102bafc9a9437705433c3 yeah i really like knight of malice 
3983.0,e56ce561e44974fa367053a5954c580c9a8585f0,thats racist 
4034.0,9b71e9f7489d961dda3cda0efd30f1ca9929412b,no honor guards in the sideboard might be worth revisiting 
4039.0,e1bec1ed4f9f72befa9fab4c73de54400439e870,speaking of malice 
4039.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,i remember when i played mardu aggro in the last standard jadelight/wildgrowth feels horrible 
4052.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,no tocatli in the sideboard to trade for adantos is probably a mistake 
4077.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,and just like that all the hard work we spent being aggressive erased 
4087.0,03008aca4787c9fe297d1af81cc0ca41ed50b503,man it's a shame knight synergies are bad it would've been cool to see some tribal in standard

4311.0,6f1494cca93302d1762ffb0632e0f740a6d8a25d,would something like cast down or moment of craving make sense in this deck as cheap removal to allow keeping pressure on 
4317.0,9ee2c7947b0d89803cc2ac70d4935533741fe535,opp is very deliberate 
4337.0,10c96861287ba8411d4c68033e4a9d754f72d2cf,opponent just wants to actually see their clock without having to hover over it /s

4439.0,321fc2cc034b9e72693e7b2f2a311267446b4384,i never got lucky with sultai 
4453.0,e4eb40033b8420927cb95bc8177d343f500dc985,sometimes i intentionally play a tad slowly to see if the opponent concedes kappa 
4473.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,i had a pretty good time against it with mardu but i was pretty specialised ended up going as deep as sb drill bit and main deck sky terror

4528.0,1c3e06655d286bf3adc30b770fa3eb5b3ac2dda8,ik i hate playing mono red about to win and my opponent just rages 
4530.0,7e0160ef21ceaa42628a18bbae17aca41648f449,looping nexus with a callous dismissal is trivial with a 30 minute timer 
4535.0,7e0160ef21ceaa42628a18bbae17aca41648f449,it doesn't even change that really 
4536.0,a4f201311a774a7eb2bbd851ed4d0774d7b999b2,do you think wotc will dial down the clock to make it more relevant 
4540.0,0b1413d4217e27dd86ed24be995bdc8fc9253992,30 minutes seems weird with modo having 25 minute clock and it being snail speed compared to arena 
4546.0,108fefd88e448a9f7eee998eb99db7db79e46e7c,do you think they'll slowly dial back the clock 
4553.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,or their win condition was removed 
4554.0,7e0160ef21ceaa42628a18bbae17aca41648f449,oh yeah that won't work 
4554.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,no black mana here is rough 
4565.0,c42b8f6870e456fa86977ded4cefe209104129cf,i'm sure that the high clock time was deliberate they want the turn timer to be the main time constraint the match clock is just a safety valve for tournaments there's a reason they don't show it by default they want it to be irrelevant in 99% of matches 
4566.0,0c9f57991cfc6efb19bbbcdbddfb1a6944fc565f,clock is only in bo3 
4566.0,7e0160ef21ceaa42628a18bbae17aca41648f449,it's going to be hex all over again 
4571.0,d929c21c2d4c491e6053485d8375f54426013078,now that there's a chess clock maybe there will be a speed chess variant

4601.0,321fc2cc034b9e72693e7b2f2a311267446b4384,arena dumb down the game it thinks for u 
4602.0,4a5907041b8499629f24b7106f443267e2d2b487,clearly what they need to do is print hate cards that affect the chess clock

4611.0,64ac72a3f214d5e5bc2631dc36602f744886ee3c,there are matches in my nexus deck where 15 would be a little tight sometimes but 20 would easily be fine 
4615.0,10c96861287ba8411d4c68033e4a9d754f72d2cf,it may be counter to normal wotc operation but once they get some real data on our mean and stdev they should be able to make a better decision on reasonable time for chess clock 
4625.0,cc6b441473214bb941d00ffff3070f6d99c1293d,that would help people work on their time game for sure one of the many important skills people ignore

4651.0,c42b8f6870e456fa86977ded4cefe209104129cf,i don't expect the clock time to decrease i think they want the turn timer to be the main time constraint the match clock is just a safety valve for tournaments there's a reason they don't show it by default they want it to be irrelevant in 99% of matches 
4656.0,a4f201311a774a7eb2bbd851ed4d0774d7b999b2,there could be a new speed mode format where each player only gets 5/10 mins of chess clock

6578.0,845d00f3093fb0ebbffec3bb285d92818eb91edc,from my experience not data by any means splashing blue for little tef in ww aggro has been close to free for sure it has a non-negligible impact because of shock lands but i mean to say it wouldnt knock monor from the top tier of decks being played 
6603.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,blue mana for frenzy would suck black mana for light up the stage spectale i feel like would not be so bad just because red black aggression is still pretty good and just putting the 8 duals into the monoblack shell wouldnt be too bad 
6616.0,ba85b38ef3a6a953e3cde6114de80b24e2e5c9b1,tempo storm surely they must require you to either play tempo or storm right haha

6706.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,one of the things i love about the rw mettle deck we played before is that history into history into heroic reinforcements is so dumb and good 
6726.0,9b71e9f7489d961dda3cda0efd30f1ca9929412b,history into history into anything does tend to win games 
6731.0,eb6a4490fe016cf1ae17940a5251abe2fb09ecb4,yup i play a ton of mono white i absolutely refuse to splash if you're not deploying threats that actively close the game you're not winning splashing in those kinds of decks with imperfect mana feels miserable more often than not 
6761.0,ba85b38ef3a6a953e3cde6114de80b24e2e5c9b1,that trade is a win for us i think 
6767.0,fbc440911d9b61a9c391065a7b083d65e32ec422,this deck is pretty sweet

6926.0,6d768cff9e5299140be647bca18b716c1f110ee5,pretty tempted to pay you to play that tbh 
6933.0,eb6a4490fe016cf1ae17940a5251abe2fb09ecb4,i feel like the r&d really swings between polar opposites they either are super careful about what they print for mono red or they're like mono red sucks what's the worst that can happen? and then they print cards like pheonix warboss light up the stage etc lol

7034.0,64514d39d7621b58764bdead56bd2f03d3189573,hey jeff how do you feel a mono blue list with sphinx of insight splashing baby tef would perform these days 
7040.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,nissa is such a fun and good card 
7077.0,2231800bb4e394d2a6652e1d6ec1ffa91b99660f,running this without krasis seems very very odd

7122.0,3b9449fcf1c86bd70c1dc9a2662ab0b2f479d0f4,this seems like its built to beat sparky 
7125.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,is about to make it as fun as possible

7142.0,c42b8f6870e456fa86977ded4cefe209104129cf,kefnet doesn't seem great in this list is it here just for the legendary big butt 
7149.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,i put together this deck right when the new standard hit i think i went like 3-7 in my 10 test games 
7167.0,d0322e3db4dd51055c268a5ce939e8ece370ef77,and 2 of those wins were just nissa beating people to death with lands 
7178.0,7c56357c69f89a488a63ef2b33e123a3cb1b2831,being a 4/5 for 4 is the main reason why keffnet is a good card 
7184.0,321fc2cc034b9e72693e7b2f2a311267446b4384,yes 
7191.0,7a62c676314c629a52c90c33024eb954499bfe3a,flipping tamio also lets you rebuy the vov and play it again since it puts the lands in untapped right

8380.0,12f90acd2573cc7d8b1a793853d7a2c224f503e4,what would you think about multani in the sideboard instead of pelakka wurm it's a big legendary threat that tramples it does a similar job to pelakka wurm but is also picked up by vow and gets stronger with vow being able to pick up lands as well it also stays big if the lands from nissa's uptick are destroyed 8141ddc5687c0d8e1002056ade07d8172b00fb0f basically my argument is that it provides more synergy than pelakka wurm
